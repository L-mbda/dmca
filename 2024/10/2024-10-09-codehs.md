My name is [private] and I am a [private] at CodeHS. We are an educational company dedicated to promoting computer science education and providing a world class CS curriculum and learning environment to everyone. Naturally, the unauthorized posting of proprietary solutions to our quizzes, exercises, challenges, and other curricular material presents a real and present threat not only to our relationships with teachers and local educational authorities, but more importantly to the learning process and academic integrity of all users or our site.  
  
We have noticed that a number of posts on [private] are publishing assessment answers and exercise solutions from CodeHS without permission of CodeHS, the sole copyright holder. This is a violation of the CodeHS Terms of Use, which states: These Terms of Use permit you to use the Website for your personal, non-commercial use only. You must not reproduce, distribute, modify, create derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, republish, download, store or transmit any of the material on our Website, except that you may print or download one copy of a reasonable number of pages of the Website for your own personal, non-commercial use and not for further reproduction, publication or distribution.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  
  
As stated explicitly in this repository's readme file (https://github.com/31Carlton7/apcs-codehs/tree/master#readme), the folders and files contained in this repository and its forks correspond to the lessons in the CodeHS course "AP Computer Science A." This repository hosts our proprietary and copyrighted answers which constitute a violation of our Terms of Use. Additionally, teachers are reporting that students are using to cheat, which undermines academic integrity for students learning computer science.  
  
Here is a link to an outline of the course modules: https://codehs.com/course/6165/explore?lang=en - please note how the numbers in each unit subfolder correspond to unit/lesson numbers in this course.  
  
Here are several screenshots demonstrating how the code in this repository matches or is nearly identical to our proprietary curricular content:
