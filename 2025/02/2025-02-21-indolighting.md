Dear GitHub Trust & Safety Team,

I am writing on behalf of INDO Technologies Ltd, the rightful owner of copyrighted product images that have been unlawfully used on the website ianemp.github.io, which is hosted on GitHub Pages via the repository [private].

The infringing website openly admits that the images were taken of returns to Indo Lighting Ltd between [private], which directly corresponds to the period when the Respondents were employed at Indo Lighting Ltd. Under [private] copyright law, any work created by an employee in the course of their employment belongs to the employer unless otherwise agreed. On the 20th December 2024, the business and assets of INDO Lighting Ltd including all intellectual property, including these images, was purchased by INDO Technologies Ltd, making us the rightful copyright holder (https://indolighting.com/a-new-chapter-begins/).

The Respondents do not own these images and had no legal right to retain or publish them after their employment ended. Their continued use constitutes clear copyright infringement and unauthorized publication of internal company materials.

1. Identification of Copyrighted Work  
The copyrighted works being infringed are proprietary images of INDO Technologies Ltd’s lighting products, which were:

Taken during quality control activities at Indo Lighting Ltd.  
Created by Indo Lighting Ltd employees during their employment.  
Admitted by the Respondents to have been taken between [private], as stated on the infringing website.  
As Indo Lighting Ltd owned these images at the time they were taken, and INDO Technologies Ltd has since acquired all intellectual property from Indo Lighting Ltd, we hold the exclusive copyright to these images.

2. Identification of Infringing Material  
GitHub Repository: [private]  
GitHub Pages Site: ianemp.github.io  
Alias Domain: [private] (redirects to ianemp.github.io)  
Hosting IP: [private]  
Screenshots of the Infringing Material (attached)  
The infringing website states:  
"Below are examples of products returned to INDO Lighting Ltd between [private]."

This directly confirms that these images were created while the Respondents were employed at Indo Lighting Ltd, proving that they were created as part of their employment duties and are owned by the Complainant.

3. Good Faith Statement  
I have a good faith belief that the use of the copyrighted material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law. The Respondents explicitly admit that these images were taken while they were employees, meaning they had no legal right to retain or publish them after leaving Indo Lighting Ltd.

4. Accuracy & Authority Statement  
The information in this notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, I confirm that I am authorized to act on behalf of INDO Technologies Ltd, the owner of the exclusive rights in question.

5. Requested Action  
I request the immediate removal of the infringing repository and website under GitHub’s DMCA Takedown Policy.

Kind regards,  
[private]
