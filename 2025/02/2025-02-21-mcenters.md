I am the [private] of "M Centers App", "Akshnav" and related "github pages websites" who distributed it as "M Centers".  
In my young life, I developed this M Centers Piracy tool to get Minecraft from Mojang Studios for free but its a paid game. As I grew up, I closed the distribution of it across all platforms. I contacted the staff from various repositories to remove M Centers but they denied to do it.  
M Centers source code was made public but it was clearly stated that its not open source software and no redistribution , forking or other stuff is allowed for this repository.  
In 2024 Mojang did strike [private] on my original repository but forks are still out there.  
They deny my request to remove the code by claiming that I have no ownership over it. They also keep my old app versions repositories.

They also have written my life story in their github pages website which I want that It should be removed.  
I will be providing urls using wayback machine to prove existence of ownership.
https://github.com/OpenM-Project/mcdoc.github.io is not by me and discusses m centers and apps similar to m centers alot. It provides download links for app , tutorial, support links and top of that discusses my life story. The owner has no cooperated in removing the requested content.
