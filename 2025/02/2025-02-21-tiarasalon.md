Dear GitHub DMCA Agent,

I am writing to formally report a copyright infringement pursuant to Section 512(c) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). The following GitHub repository contains unauthorized copies of proprietary code and sensitive information from our client's website:

Infringing Content Location: Repository URL: https://github.com/MikyMack/Lafanta-saloon

Original Material Location: Original Website: https://tiarasalon.com

Description of Infringement: The repository in question contains unauthorized copies of the entire source code from our client's website. Evidence strongly suggests that HTTrack, a website mirroring tool, was used to copy the site's HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other assets without permission.

What is HTTrack? HTTrack is a free (GPL, libre/free software) and easy-to-use offline browser utility. It allows users to download an entire website from the Internet to a local directory, recursively copying all HTML, images, and other files while maintaining the website's structure. This tool was clearly used to clone our client's website without authorization, making the repository a direct reproduction of copyrighted content.

I am attaching a screenshot as evidence showing clear signs that HTTrack was used to scrape and copy our client's website in its entirety. Given the nature of the infringement, I am explicitly claiming that the entire repository is infringing upon the original copyrighted work and request its complete removal from GitHub. I have taken fair use into consideration.

By this letter, I declare under penalty of perjury that:

- I am authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner whose exclusive rights are being infringed.  
- I have a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.  
- The information in this notification is accurate.  
- I understand that under Section 512(f) of the DMCA, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability for damages.  

Requested Actions: I request that GitHub:

1. Immediately remove or disable access to the infringing repository.  
2. Notify the repository owner of this takedown notice.  
3. Notify us once the repository has been removed or access has been disabled.  

Please find the attached screenshot evidence demonstrating the unauthorized use of HTTrack to copy the website. If you require any further information to process this request, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Sincerely,
