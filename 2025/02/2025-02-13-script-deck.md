Clone of [private] Plugin "Wall Script"  
Published Sep 12, 2024

- The repository I want to report as a rip-off of [private] plugin

[private]

- [private] original version is released in November 2023, his in September 2024, though he writes in his readme "Copyright 2024 - [private]."


- The plugin title seems oddly rephrased from my version (“Wall Script”? That doesn’t even make sense and seems like a mingle up of the original name “Script Deck”, which is obviously a deck of buttons to launch scripts. 


- His clone has the exact same functionality. Mine is a paid plugin with manual, user support (like I offer for all my plugins since 2018).  
His is free which potentially cuts off my earnings for the effort I have put into inventing, designing, programming, documenting my original plugin.

See screenshots above

- About Text just a rephrased version of [private] about text  
- [private] : "A Single shortcut – Access all your scripts with one shortcut ... With just a few button clicks, you can say goodbye to the hassle of digging through script menus or trying to remember complicated shortcuts."  
vs.
His: "You do not need memorize too much shortcut for favorite scripts, just define shortcut for wall script and use it instead of all shortcut."  
- [private] : "One of the key features of Script Deck is its high level of customization. You have the ability to personalize your experience by setting colors and icons for quick recognition. Additionally, you can name your decks, allowing for easy organization and quick identification of your scripts."  
vs.  
His: "Add script to each block of wall then when you click on block, attached script runs. You can change color of block to find it more easily in the wall or change/delete attached script when you want."  
and so on


- in July 2024, he made compliments and had a feature request for my plugin, before he made his version

[private]

- His plugin seems to be written with help of AI by feeding it with my plugin images including a description, as he has no GitHub history from before the release of his clone.

[private]

- [private] opened an issue in his repository, asking him to take down his repository.

[private]

He first answered

[private]

- where to [private] answered:
- 
[private]

- Then no answer by him, but he closed the issue and locked and limited the issue.

[private]

- This seemed already like a confession that he stole my idea and does not want to deal with my concerns. So [private] opened a second issue:

[private]


- Again no answer, but this time he even renamed both [private] issues in his repo to "." and "..", edited all my text to "." and deleted his answers.
- finally he locked his repo from any new all issues to be created.
