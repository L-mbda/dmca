Dear Sir or Madam,

I, [private], residing at [private], hereby submit this notification in accordance with the provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) regarding the unauthorized publication of content to which I have contributed substantially.



==================================================================



I. Identification of Infringing Repositories

The infringing content is accessible at the following URLs:  
• https://github.com/Latte-Corporation/Mixify  
• https://github.com/Latte-Corporation/Mixify-api



==================================================================



II. Background and Context

I am the [private] of the micro-enterprise Launchmachine Music and, as the [private] of an innovative entertainment project, [private] initiated the development of an application intended for commercial use by various establishments. On November 27, 2024, during a meeting among friends – with [private] present as a witness – [private] presented [private] concept in detail to [private] (alias “[private]”, GitHub account: [private]). Prior to that meeting, [private] had also discussed the project with [private] over the phone.



[private] agreed to contribute voluntarily to the development of the application, and we collaborated closely from December 3, 2024. During this collaboration, [private] provided [private] with detailed instructions on both the functional and graphical aspects of the project, as evidenced by a shared note, various written communications, and messages exchanged on [private]. These elements clearly demonstrate that the direction of the project – in terms of design and functionality – originated entirely from [private] vision.



On December 13, 2024, a dispute arose regarding the future revenue distribution. While [private] proposed an equitable 50/50 split, [private] unilaterally demanded 70% of the revenues and explicitly threatened to publish the code as open source without [private] prior consent. Although a verbal agreement was reached on December 17, 2024, stipulating that the tool would not be published without [private] consent, [private] proceeded, unilaterally and without [private] authorization, to publish the collaborative code.



Subsequently, after [private] sent him a message upon discovering his unauthorized publication, [private] blocked [private] on all social networks. As a result, I no longer have any means of contacting him.



Furthermore, throughout the development process, [private] meticulously documented [private] contributions (instructions, designs created using [private] and native tools on [private] MacBook Pro, email exchanges, and other written communications). To secure the protection of [private] concept and the structure of the tool, [private] registered an [private] envelope with the INPI on January 09, 2025.



==================================================================



III. Legal Basis

I declare, under penalty of perjury, that:

1. I have a good faith belief that the publication of the content hosted on the aforementioned repositories constitutes an unauthorized use of my intellectual contributions, which include the design, structure, and technical directives that guided the development of the application.

2. The evidence provided confirms my significant role in the conception and development of the project, thereby contributing to the creation of an original and protectable work.

3. No express authorization was granted for the public publication of this content, and its publication thus violates the rights I hold over the foundational elements of the project.

4. I have taken fair use into consideration. The publication of the content in question does not fall under fair use, as it involves the unauthorized public distribution of proprietary material initially developed for commercial purposes.



==================================================================



IV. Request

In light of the foregoing, I kindly request that you promptly remove or block access to the infringing content hosted at the specified URLs, in accordance with the provisions of the DMCA. Given that the unauthorized publication of this content violates my intellectual property rights and does not meet fair use criteria, I kindly request its immediate removal.

Additionally, I have consulted with a legal professional regarding this matter, and I am currently considering legal action to protect my intellectual property rights. I urge GitHub to take swift action to prevent further unauthorized distribution of this content.



==================================================================
