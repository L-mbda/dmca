Hello, my name is [private], representative of CSCMobi [private] company  
I am sending this content with a request to delete this repo, this is the source code of our product, a product that is currently being sold on the app market.  
I have emailed the owner of the github account and the infringing game on the store but have not received any response.  
I have submitted a report to remove the game on CHPlay and the infringing game has been removed  
I have requested the github support department to remove this copyrighted content to help us reduce unnecessary damage.  
I would like to attach a link to the video of the infringing game built from the infringing source code that currently exists on github in public mode.  
The source code is a product of a cooking game on mobile, we are currently still selling this product on mobile, recently I learned about this violating github link because I received a notice from google cloud about a leaked key and was pointed to the git link of an old partner of ours and maybe they were leaked at a certain time, leading to some people forking this source code and setting it to public mode.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Original game: Cooking Love  
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cscmobi.cooking.love.free  
Offending game: Cooking travel (built from the infringing sourcecode currently on github), this game has been removed from chplay due to copyright infringement reports  
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.viphong.cookingtravel.cook.free.cooking  
Video recorded in game:
