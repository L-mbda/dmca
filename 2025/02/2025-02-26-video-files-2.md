DMCA Notice for copyright infringement

The following information serves to assert my rights and request removal of
allegedly infringing web content under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
(DMCA). The following is a report, in good faith, of alleged copyright
infringement. I am contacting you as the designated agent for the site upon
which the infringing work currently appears. This letter is a Notice of
Infringement as authorized in 512(c) of the U.S. Copyright Law.

I am the [private] of the works and the following is true and accurate.

[private] own full rights to these videos. [private] also have 2257's, ID's and model releases for them. [private] also have signed documents from the original producer(s) certifying [private] own them.

The allegedly infringing content appears at the following location(s) online:
https://github.com/gugu-hw/rarbg-db-dumps

These entire repositories are infringing as they share multiple links to content for which [private] own copyrights to. They also share and provide ways to facilitate piracy of said content.

Files are a backup of the entire rarbg database and contain multiple torrent and/or magnet links to content [private] own the copyrights to.  
Thus, the entire repository is infringing upon the original work I identified in the notice.

I have taken fair use into consideration.

The original copyrighted content is/was posted online at:  
[private]  
[private]  
(*) There are various 18+ porn videos from these or other sites that [private] own that are directly linked in these files. These files are behind a paid membership area, so aren't fully available publicly.


Based on the representative number of forks I have reviewed, I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository.

All related forks should also be taken down.

These should be taken down:

My contact information, as [private], is as follows:

I have a good faith belief the use of the above reference copyrighted
work(s) that appears on the website for which you are the designated DMCA
agent is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or by law.

I declare, under penalty of perjury, this notice is true and correct and
that I am the copyright owner entitled to exclusive rights which I allege
are being infringed.
