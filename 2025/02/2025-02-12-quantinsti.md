**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

We are using DRM protection tools currently to identify such infringments.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

At the time the unauthorized download occurred, QuantInsti had not yet implemented current DRM protection tools on the course content. However, the content was strictly prohibited to be downloaded and distributed as per the user terms. The accused project still constitutes a clear case of copyright infringement and unauthorized distribution of our proprietary material.

The user gained access to the content and violated our platform’s terms of use, which strictly prohibit copying, downloading, or redistributing course materials.

Furthermore, by uploading the copyrighted content to a public GitHub repository and allowing it to be forked multiple times, the user actively facilitates the circumvention of our access control mechanisms. This public distribution undermines our ability to enforce copyright protections and restricts access to rightful users.

Given these circumstances, we request the immediate removal of the infringing material and all associated forks.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes, we have identified 7 forks related to the infringed repository, we have mentioned the urls of forks in the section for files/urls to be taken down.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
