Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Our software requires periodic online validation to confirm that the software being used is legitimate. This ensures that unauthorized users cannot easily access the software without first authenticating against our secure licensing systems.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The repository provides a key generation tool that allows users to bypass the software's license validation process. This tool generates valid license keys for our software, which directly undermines our encryption and licensing systems designed to ensure that only authorized users can access the software

Yes, I have checked for any forks of the infringing repository. At this time, the repository at https://github.com/HackMogador/Warez-RadiXX11-RCE is the only one I am aware of that is infringing on our copyrights. If additional forks are found in the future, I will submit additional requests.
