Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

We respectfully submit this response to address the erroneous DMCA takedown notice filed against our repository. The claim asserts that our project, ServerSeeker, is an infringement of the complainant’s software, ServerSeekerV2, which is developed by the organization they refer to as “The Fifth Column Boring.” However, this is a significant misrepresentation of both the complainant’s identity and the facts of the matter.

The correct name of our organization is The Fifth Column, and we have no association with the term “Boring” as it pertains to our group. The complainant appears to have added “Boring” incorrectly in their claim, creating confusion regarding the affiliation between our projects.

Our project, ServerSeeker, is an entirely separate and original software solution developed by our group, The Fifth Column. It is not related to or derived from ServerSeekerV2 in any way. We own and operate the website serverseeker.net, which links to our official GitHub repository: https://github.com/ogmur/serverseeker. This repository clearly demonstrates the independent and original nature of our project.

Additionally, we affirm that the code in our repository has not been copied or derived from any third-party sources, including the ServerSeekerV2 repository maintained by the complainant at [invalid].

Given that the claim is based on false information regarding both the ownership of the software and the identity of the parties involved, we respectfully request that this DMCA takedown be revoked and our repository reinstated.

We are happy to provide any additional information or clarification needed to resolve this matter and avoid any further miscommunication.

Thank you for your attention to this issue.
