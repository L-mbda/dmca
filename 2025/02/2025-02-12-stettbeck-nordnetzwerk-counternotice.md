Yes, I am the content owner.

**Please describe the nature of your content ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter Notice. [private] created these web applications that were used by "NordNetzwerk". Neither the name "NordNetzwerk" nor the name "Stettbeck" is protected under any copyright law. The projects were created by [private] and not by the person which tried/took down the projects. The copyright of the "NordNetzwerk" Logo belongs to [private]. The other logos were used by permission by the copyright holder back then and now are used or provided to the public by fair-use. No one at these non-legal-binding projects owns any copyright to any used content.

**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

[private] have left the project quite a while ago. While the project lost more and more attention, they will soon try to relaunch it. To not have anyone else use the projects [private] created (under no contractual obligation to them) they are trying to take these down.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**
