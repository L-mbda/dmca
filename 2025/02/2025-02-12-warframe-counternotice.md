**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

Yes. The takedown request does not specify which parts of the repository allegedly infringe upon Digital Extremes' copyright. The SpaceNinjaServer repository does not contain any Warframe source code, assets, or proprietary materials. It is an independent server implementation based on publicly available information and does not provide unauthorized access to Digital Extremes' game.

Since the takedown request is overly broad and does not identify specific infringing content, I believe the removal was a mistake. I am willing to address any legitimate concerns, but I cannot comply with a blanket takedown request that lacks clear justification.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**
