The copyrighted work in question is [private] original game, "Octopus Game (Squid Game)," created and published on the Roblox platform. This game includes unique scripts, mechanics, assets, and intellectual property that [private] developed and own the rights to.

This script enables users to manipulate gameplay unfairly, affecting the integrity of [private] work and the experience of legitimate players.
This unauthorized script, hosted on GitHub, is being distributed without [private] consent and is harming [private] game's integrity. I respectfully request its immediate removal.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

[private] game, "Octopus Game (Squid Game)" on the Roblox platform, has multiple technological measures in place to control access to its copyrighted material and prevent unauthorized modifications or exploitation:

Server-Side Security & Validation: All critical game logic and data handling occur on the server, ensuring that unauthorized modifications on the client side cannot directly alter the game’s core functionality.

Anti-Exploit Mechanisms: The game implements anti-cheat and anti-exploit scripts designed to detect and block unauthorized actions, including modification of game scripts or unintended interactions.

Roblox's Filtering Enabled (FE) System: This built-in security feature restricts client-side scripts from making unauthorized changes to the game state, ensuring that only legitimate game actions are processed by the server.

Obfuscation and Asset Protection: Proprietary scripts and assets are protected using various security techniques, making it difficult for unauthorized users to access or modify core components of the game.

How these measures effectively control access:  
These security mechanisms are designed to prevent unauthorized modifications or exploitation of my game. However, the infringing content (the exploit script) bypasses these protections, allowing users to modify game behavior without permission. This circumvention directly violates my copyright and DMCA protections.

I request the immediate removal of this unauthorized script to prevent further violations.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project is designed to circumvent the technological protection measures implemented in my game, "Octopus Game (Squid Game)" on Roblox, in the following ways:

Bypassing Anti-Exploit Mechanisms: The infringing script enables users to modify gameplay and game mechanics, bypassing the anti-cheat and anti-exploit protections that I have implemented. This allows for unauthorized actions within the game, such as manipulating game states or accessing restricted features.

Manipulating Client-Side Scripts: The exploit script interacts with client-side elements, which directly violates Roblox's Filtering Enabled (FE) security measures. FE ensures that the game’s core scripts and functionalities are controlled server-side, but the exploit circumvents this by injecting custom client-side commands.

Disabling or Overriding Game Security: The script is capable of disabling certain security checks or bypassing them entirely, which undermines the integrity of the game and allows for unfair gameplay. This makes it possible for users to cheat or gain an unfair advantage by exploiting the game.

These actions directly violate the copyright protections and anti-circumvention rules established under the DMCA. I request the immediate removal of this unauthorized content to safeguard the integrity of my game.
