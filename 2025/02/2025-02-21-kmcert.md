The above URLs are post URLs that post the libraries (modules) and sample sources provided only to users who have signed a contract with Korea Mobile Authentication Co., Ltd. on the GITHUB repository. The ICERTSecu_JDK18.jar file is a library file that encrypts character strings copyrighted by Korea Mobile Authentication Co., Ltd., and is being posted and used without permission.  
Additionally, the txt file path is a file that records how to use modules and sample sources in implementing the services we provide.
And the codes written in the 9 kmcis_web_sample_step.jsp files are code that uses the ICERTSecu_JDK18.jar library and a process format that uses our service, and the URL that calls our service is https://www.kmcert.com/kmcis/webc_CI/kmcisReqProc.jsp“, “https://www.kmcert.com/kmcis/webc_CI/kmcisRetProc.jsp” has been created and the source code that makes unauthorized service calls is posted.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Providing or using our services to anyone other than those who have contracted with our services is prohibited. Unless you sign a contract with our service, we do not provide related libraries (modules) and service implementation sources. Additionally, even if you have signed a contract with our service, unauthorized posting of content related to our work in open spaces such as GITHUB is illegal, so we may be held legally responsible.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

Currently, it is unclear whether the defendant project has signed a contract with us, and it is presumed that a third party other than the current contracting party posted the post without permission, so Korea Mobile Certification Co., Ltd. may be held legally responsible for this.

No, but we will continue to look for repositories that post our work without permission.

No

Reported content must be removed
