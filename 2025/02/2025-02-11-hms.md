Dear GitHub [private],   
Hope this email finds you well.  
I am writing to express my sincere gratitude for your team's remarkable assistance in handling the code infringement issue last time. Your professionalism and dedication were truly impressive. In particular, I was deeply touched by the fact that your team carefully monitored the forking of my code and provided me with a very helpful link: https://github.com/RunningJimmy/HMS/network/members.  
I have thoroughly reviewed each piece of code in the above - mentioned link and confirmed that it is identical to the code I originally shared. Therefore, I earnestly request your team to help me take down or privatize the code repository at https://github.com/RunningJimmy/HMS/network/members. This is of great significance for safeguarding my code rights. Thank you very much again for your strong support!
