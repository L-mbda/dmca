Re: Unauthorized Use of Electronic Arts Intellectual Property (Sims Assets)

Dear DMCA Agent,

I write on behalf of Electronic Arts Inc. and its wholly owned development studio Maxis (together, “EA”), publisher and developer of the widely known and successful video game franchise, The Sims. EA owns all intellectual property rights related to The Sims, including copyrights in source code and audiovisual materials of The Sims video games and related downloadable content (“Copyrighted Content”). More information about the Copyrighted Content can be found at our website https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims.

It has come to our attention that your website is being used to host the Copyrighted Content without EA’s permission. Specifically, a user named “mintalien” has uploaded asset files extracted from The Sims 2 video game. The infringing materials are located at:

https://github.com/mintalien/The-Puppets-2-Definitive-Edition/releases/tag/v13.2  
https://github.com/mintalien/The-Puppets-2-Definitive-Edition/releases/tag/v12  
https://github.com/mintalien/The-Puppets-2-Definitive-Edition/releases/tag/v11  
https://github.com/mintalien/The-Puppets-2-Definitive-Edition/releases/tag/v7  
https://github.com/mintalien/The-Puppets-2-Definitive-Edition/releases/tag/v1  

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. Pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), 17 U.S.C. § 512(c), we ask that you or mintalien immediately and permanently disable and/or block access to the infringing materials on your website.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed

This letter is not intended to be a full statement of the facts, and it does not prejudice or waive any claim, whether in law or in equity, that EA may have with respect to this matter or any other matter.

 

Thank you,  
/s/ [private]
