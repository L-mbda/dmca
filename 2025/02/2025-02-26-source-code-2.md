**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] [private] and [private] copyright holder of the project in question. The code, structure, and implementation were developed by [private] over the course of several months, and I have documented its creation on [private] [private] [private] ([private]). The repository in question is a direct copy of [private] work, which was initially public but later made private. The unauthorized user did not fork the project or request permission but instead copied and re-uploaded it as their own.

I am submitting this request as the rightful owner to protect my intellectual property.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original copyrighted work consists of a full-stack web application, including a frontend built with Vue.js and a backend API developed using Spring Boot. This project required extensive development over several months and includes unique business logic, API endpoints, database schema design, and UI components that were all created by [private].

The project was initially hosted publicly on [private] GitHub repository, but [private] later made it private. However, before [private] did so, an unauthorized third party copied the entire codebase and re-uploaded it under their own repository without any modifications or attribution.

Here are the infringing repositories:

Frontend Copy: github.com/DercioMachine/xicola-frontend original repository [private]  
Backend Copy: github.com/DercioMachine/xicola.api original repository [private]

I request the immediate removal of these unauthorized copies as they infringe on [private] copyright.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repositories contain unauthorized copies of [private] original work. I request the complete removal of the following repositories:

Frontend Copy: https://github.com/DercioMachine/xicola-frontend  
Backend Copy: https://github.com/DercioMachine/xicola.api  
These repositories were copied in their entirety from [private] original work without permission.

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes, I have searched for forks of the infringing repositories. At this time, I request the removal of the following repositories:

Frontend Copy: https://github.com/DercioMachine/xicola-frontend  
Backend Copy: https://github.com/DercioMachine/xicola.api  
If any forks exist that also contain [private] copyrighted work, I request their removal as well. Please let me know if additional steps are needed to identify them.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
