I am an [private] at the University of Manitoba. I retain copyright on intellectual property that I produce as part of my duties in coordinating, organizing, and delivering [private], including [private].

The part of the collective agreement for the union that I am a member of describing copyright ownership and intellectual property can be found here: [private]

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

I gave permission for [private] registered in [private] [private] to use several segments of code that [private] wrote. The permission [private] gave [private] is to use the code in [private] they are submitting for assessment, but they do not have permission to publish the code as part of their own work. In the file `exfat.c` in the linked repository this includes lines 20--62 (the `unicode2ascii` function) and lines 64--151 (a sequence of `struct` describing data structures in the exFAT file system).

Additionally, I prepared several exFAT-formatted volumes for [private] to use to test the work that they are submitting for assessment. Again: [private] had permission to use these, but not to reproduce or publish them.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**
