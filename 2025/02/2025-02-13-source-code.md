The user (trinhminhtriet) who has taken [private] code (https://github.com/jdrouet/catapulte) and published it under a new app name (https://github.com/trinhminhtriet/mailify) without proper attribution is violating the terms of the AGPLv3 license. To bring the repository into compliance with the AGPLv3, the following changes are required:

Restore proper attribution: The user must restore [private] (as the original author) in all places where it was originally present in the code and other relevant files.

Preserve the AGPLv3 license: The full text of the AGPLv3 license must be included in the repository. If it was removed or altered, the user must restore it exactly as it was in the original repository. This includes ensuring that the license text is included in a LICENSE file or, at a minimum, within the code files.

Indicate modifications: Any changes the user has made to the original code must be clearly documented. This could be in a CHANGELOG or comments in the code itself, showing what has been modified from the original work.

Make the source code available: The user must also ensure that the AGPLv3's requirement to provide access to the source code (or a written offer to do so) is honored.

If these changes are not made, the repository will remain in violation of the AGPLv3 license, and I kindly ask that you assist in resolving this issue.

Additionally, I confirm the following statements as required by GitHub's DMCA process:

"I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law."

"I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed."

"I have taken fair use into consideration."

As requested in our previous exchange, here are my personal informations:

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
