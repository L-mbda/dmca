The Github project "dutymachine" mined and thus copied verbatim an article written by [private] ([private]) published on [private], on Sanlian News, the magazine that [private] for. Because this article can be Googled and viewed for free via the Github link, it infringes on my copyright right to publish my works. I do not petition "dutymachine" to not use it for mining and analyzing data, but I would like it to not be publicly accessable in this manner (not viewable by everyone for free, and not findable on Google).

It is a newspaper/magazine article consisting of [private] analysis and interviews with numerous individuals involved in a headline event in the U.S. last May. It is infringed because dutymachine copied it and published it on Github verbatim.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

I would like the said article by dutymachine to be deleted, or no longer viewable by the public.
