I am writing to you from Digiturk, the largest PAY TV in [private], holding the broadcast rights for Turkish Super League Football Matches, 90 minutes live events, broadcasted to our subscribers, based on a paid subscription.

I found out that there have been copyright infringements in the form of illegal stream URL sharing, based on the Digital Milennium Copyright Act (http://www.copyright.gov) and International Copyright Infringement Regulations.

It is obviously clear that these shared illegal stream URL links allow piracy for our exclusive broadcasts to be viewed without our authorization.
Digiturk owns the copyright of the content which is allowed to be viewed illegally by means of HTML outside of Digiturk's subscription system. The reported content is preconfigured to share the broadcasts with some Digiturk accounts built in which have been provided without the authorization of Digiturk. These apks allows our broadcasts to be viewed illegally and downloadable from your system, hence to be removed.

Please note that all of the broadcast rights of these events belong to our company’s channel http://tr.beinsports.com Sharing of illegal stream URL links which give rise to infringement of our copyrights can be prevented by filing a claim on your site for the infringing material which will result in a court order of blocking the access to the site at issue entirely within the territory, which we believe that all of your members/clients will be adversely affected and it will be inevitable for you to confront with high compensation fees additionaly.
