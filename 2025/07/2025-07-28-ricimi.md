If you are submitting this notice on behalf of a company, please be sure to use an email address on the company's domain. If you use a personal email address for a notice submitted on behalf of a company, we may not be able to process it.

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?

No.

Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?

GitHub.

Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.

I am the [private] and copyright owner of the original work.

Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.

The original copyrighted works are the following assets for Unity:

- Clean & Minimalist GUI Pack: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/gui/clean-minimalist-gui-pack-75123  
- Cartoon GUI Pack: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/gui/cartoon-gui-pack-48850

The infringing URLs are redistributing the entire contents of the assets, and you can confirm this by inspecting the ‘Package Content’ section of the original links above. Most of the contents of the assets are 2D sprites and C# scripts. Examining the contents of the infringing repositories, you can confirm every single script in the infringing folders belongs to our assets and even includes our original copyright notice in its header:

[private]

As a concrete example of this, please see the following example files:

If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.

- Cartoon GUI Pack: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/gui/cartoon-gui-pack-48850

We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.

Based on the above, I confirm that:

Specific files within the repository are infringing.

Identify only the specific file URLs within the repository that is infringing:

The infringing files are all the files contained in the following folders:

https://github.com/Dewmo123/2025GameEnginePJ1/tree/main/2025GameEnginePJ1/Assets/GUIPack-Clean%26Minimalist  
https://github.com/EungDDing/CollectiveRPG0418/tree/main/Assets/GUIPack-Clean%26Minimalist

https://github.com/demigreeen/CrashSchoolKids/tree/main/GUIPackCartoon

Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology if you are unsure.

No.

Is the work licensed under an open source license?

No.

What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?

Reported content must be removed.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

I have taken fair use into consideration.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice.
