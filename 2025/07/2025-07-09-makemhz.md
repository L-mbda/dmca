While GitHub did not find sufficient information to determine a valid anti-circumvention claim, we determined that this takedown notice contains other valid copyright claim(s).

---

To GitHub’s DMCA Agent,

[private] the [private] and [private] of MakeMHz LLC, the creator and exclusive rights holder of proprietary firmware and software developed for Project Stellar and XboxHD+. These works include original runtime logic, system-level firmware, and control software that are not publicly available and have never been released under any open-source or permissive license.

This is a formal takedown request under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), 17 U.S.C. § 512(c).

1. Copyrighted Work Infringed

The copyrighted works in question include:

Firmware and control software binaries for the XboxHD+ and Project Stellar products

Runtime and system-level logic authored exclusively by MakeMHz LLC

Proprietary software routines and update mechanisms used in our commercial hardware products

These works are distributed solely in compiled binary form and are protected under U.S. and international copyright law. No permission has been granted for redistribution, modification, reverse engineering, or derivative use.

2. Infringing Material

The GitHub repository below contains a software tool named Pandora, which is designed to download third-party software known as CERBIOS and PrometheOS automatically. Both CERBIOS and PrometheOS include, in part or in whole, unauthorized reproductions and derivative use of the proprietary logic, update mechanisms, and runtime behavior of XboxHD+ and Project Stellar.

The Pandora tool:

- Provides direct access to infringing firmware images and packages  
- Facilitates unauthorized installation of these works on modified consoles  
- Circumvents technological protection measures, including update integrity and runtime checks, in violation of 17 U.S.C. § 1201  
- Contains scripts and source code explicitly intended to deploy infringing copies of software derived from our proprietary IP

Infringing Repository URL:

https://github.com/Team-Resurgent/Pandora

While the Pandora repository itself may not contain the full binaries of CERBIOS or PrometheOS, it explicitly facilitates and automates access to them, and is thus a clear violation under the DMCA by way of contributory infringement.

3. Statement of Good Faith

I have a good faith belief that the material described above is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law, and is therefore infringing the rights of MakeMHz LLC.

4. Statement of Accuracy and Authority

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of the exclusive rights that are allegedly infringed.
