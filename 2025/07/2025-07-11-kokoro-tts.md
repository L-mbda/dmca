Attn: GitHub DMCA Agent

1. Statement of Understanding
I have read and understand GitHub’s Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

2. Identification of the copyrighted work  
The original, MIT‑licensed repository [private] is located at:  
https://github.com/nazdridoy/kokoro-tts

3. Identification of infringing material and license non‑compliance  
The infringing repository is:  
https://github.com/chaichai1428/kokoro-tts

In that fork, the LICENSE file has been completely removed, and the required copyright and permission notices mandated by the MIT License have been omitted from all source files. Under the terms of the MIT License, every copy or substantial portion of the Software:  
  • Must include the above copyright notice,  
  • Must include the permission notice (the text of the MIT License).  

By removing the LICENSE file and stripping out those notices, the infringer is no longer distributing the software under the same terms [private] granted in [private] original MIT License. This is a direct violation of Sections 1 and 2 of the MIT License, which require preservation of the copyright and permission notice in “all copies or substantial portions of the Software.”

4. Statement of unauthorized use  
I have a good‑faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing repository is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have considered fair use and believe this removal exceeds fair‑use bounds.

5. Sworn statement  
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

6. Remedy requested  
Please disable or remove access to the infringing repository (chaichai1428/kokoro-tts) until the repository is brought into compliance with the MIT License by performing ALL of the following corrective actions:  
  1. Restore the LICENSE file exactly as it appears in [private] original repository, including full text of the MIT License and [private] copyright notice.  
  2. Re‑insert the permission notice (the brief license header) at the top of every source file, matching the format used in the original kokoro‑tts repository.  
  3. Verify that every branch and any packaged releases include these notices.

Once these steps are completed, the infringing repository will again comply with the terms of the MIT License.
