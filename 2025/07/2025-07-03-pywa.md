GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and [private] of the original software project that was published on GitHub at the URL listed above. [private] hold all rights to the code and associated content in that repository, and [private] released it under the MIT License, which requires preservation of the license terms and attribution. The infringing repository reproduces [private] work without adhering to those terms.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original copyrighted work is a software project [private] created and published on GitHub at https://github.com/david-lev/pywa, titled pywa. It is a fully-featured Python framework for building WhatsApp bots using the WhatsApp Cloud API. The project includes original source code, documentation, and design for a modular and extensible bot framework.

[private] developed this project from scratch and released it under the permissive MIT License, which allows reuse and modification but requires inclusion of the license text and proper attribution to the original author.

The infringing repository, available at https://github.com/abdelhak-zaaim/whatsbyapi, is a re-uploaded copy of [private] project with a different name. It uses [private] codebase and structure but removes the original license and author attribution, and falsely presents the work as its own. This violates the terms of the MIT License and infringes upon [private] copyright.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

https://github.com/david-lev/pywa

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/abdelhak-zaaim/whatsbyapi

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

mit-license

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The MIT License requires that any redistribution or modification of the code include the original copyright notice and a copy of the license. The repository at https://github.com/abdelhak-zaaim/whatsbyapi is a re-upload of [private] project (https://github.com/david-lev/pywa) under a different name. It copies substantial portions of [private] codebase and documentation but removes the original license file and all attribution to [private] as the author. This violates the terms of the MIT License and misleads users into thinking the infringer is the original author.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

To comply with the MIT License, the repository must:

Include a copy of the original MIT License file.  
Retain the original copyright notice and attribution to [private] ([private]) as the author.  
Clearly state that the project is based on or derived from the original pywa project.  
Avoid presenting the project as solely their own original work without attribution.  
Alternatively, if the user does not want to comply with these terms, they should remove the copied code from their repository or make the repository private.  

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

The alleged infringer’s GitHub profile is https://github.com/abdelhak-zaaim

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
