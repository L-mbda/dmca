**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**  
  
Several links that your website is hosting are infringing on at least one (1) if not more copyrights(s) owned by EC-Council. The courseware of EC-Council official course like "Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)", is being unlawfully uploaded in the form of "Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) PDF" through your website without permission and in blatant violation of our proprietary rights. Furthermore, EC-Council is the owner and developer of the course "Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)" and owns copyright in all its versions which ANGELOS-TSILAFAKIS has illegally uploaded through its GitHub Account. The customers seeking EC-Council's courses may be misled into thinking that the infringing content and courses uploaded are endorsed or affiliated with EC-Council. As a result of the misrepresentation caused by the account owner, EC-Council is likely to suffer damage in the form of loss of sales, damage to its reputation, and further risks confusing our clients. We assert that this is a clear intent of riding freely on the goodwill of EC-Council.
