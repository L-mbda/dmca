**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

gnu-general-public-license-v3.0

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The GPL-3.0 license requires that any derivative or copied code:  
- includes the original license file,  
- credits the original authors,   
- remains open-source under the same GPL-3.0 license.

The repository https://github.com/BX-Team/Nexus copies substantial code from [private] projects without:  
- including the GPL license,  
- providing attribution to the original authors (EternalCodeTeam),  
- releasing the code under a compatible license (it appears proprietary or unlicensed).

This is a direct and serious violation of the GPL-3.0 terms.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

To comply with the GPL-3.0 license, the repository owner must:  
- add clear attribution to the original authors (EternalCodeTeam),  
- include the original GPL-3.0 LICENSE file in the root of the repository,  
- ensure that their repository is also licensed under GPL-3.0 (or a compatible license),  
- optionally provide a notice of changes if the code has been modified.

If they are unwilling to do so, the repository should be removed from GitHub.

**Do you have the alleged infringerâ€™s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No, I do not have contact information for the alleged infringer.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
