**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

gnu-affero-general-public-license-v3.0

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

Although the AGPL-3.0 license was added to our repository after the infringing repository was created, the code is originally our copyrighted work. The infringing repository copied our code without permission, attribution, or authorization, and does not comply with the license terms that now apply. The license requires attribution and including the license text, which they have not done.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

To comply with the AGPL-3.0 license, the repository would need to:  
Provide clear attribution to the original authors and repository (https://github.com/vxnetsh/website)  
Include the full text of the AGPL-3.0 license in the repository  
Ensure all users are made aware that the code is licensed under the AGPL-3.0  
Alternatively, the infringing repository should be removed entirely if they are not willing to comply with the license.

**Do you have the alleged infringerâ€™s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

Yes. The repository is part of an organization owned by an individual known as "[private]." Their GitHub profile is [private], where contact details may be available.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
