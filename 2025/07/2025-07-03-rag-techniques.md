**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and [private] of the original content published in the GitHub repository https://github.com/NirDiamant/RAG_Techniques. This includes the code, notebooks, prompts, documentation, and structure of the repository. The content is protected under copyright law and is licensed under a custom license that explicitly prohibits unauthorized copying, redistribution, or commercial use. [private] have not granted permission for this material to be copied or republished in any form.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original copyrighted work is [private] GitHub repository https://github.com/NirDiamant/RAG_Techniques, which contains a comprehensive collection of 22 detailed Jupyter notebooks, code, prompts, evaluation methods, and documentation focused on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques.

This work includes unique code implementations, original function names, helper functions, multi-step prompts, tutorial structures, and explanations. The organization, file names, notebook numbering, table design, and README structure were all created and written by [private]. The repository is licensed under a custom license that prohibits copying, redistribution, or commercial use without explicit permission.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/FareedKhan-dev/all-rag-techniques

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

creative-commons-zero-v1.0-universal

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The infringing repository copies [private] original work, including the structure, tutorial names, file names, code, prompts, and documentation, and republishes it under a different license (MIT) without [private] permission. While some parts of the content have been slightly altered, for example wording or variable names modified by an LLM with negligible changes, it is crystal clear that this is copying of [private] copyrighted material. The substantial similarity and overall structure make the infringement obvious.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

To bring the project into compliance with the license, the infringing repository would need to be removed entirely or made private and inaccessible to the public, as [private] custom license does not permit redistribution or modification without explicit permission. Attribution or adding a license alone would not resolve the infringement because the license prohibits unauthorized copying or sharing.

**Do you have the alleged infringerâ€™s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

[private]  
[private]

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
