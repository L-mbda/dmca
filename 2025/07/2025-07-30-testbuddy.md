Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Our original code is hosted in a [private] [private] [private] ([private], [private]), which is accessible only to authorized collaborators. Access is restricted using [private]’s built-in authentication, access controls, and permission settings to prevent unauthorized viewing, cloning, or forking of the code. Only team members added explicitly to the repository could access or contribute to the project.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused individual, a former intern, had temporary, limited access to our private GitHub repositories as part of their internship. Upon termination of their role and removal from all organizational access, they retained a copy of the proprietary source code without permission. They then uploaded it to four public GitHub repositories listed below, effectively bypassing the [private] access controls and confidentiality boundaries in place. This intentional act of uploading restricted code publicly constitutes a clear circumvention of technological protection measures and is a direct violation of copyright law.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>.
