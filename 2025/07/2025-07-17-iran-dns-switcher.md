**1. A detailed description of the original copyrighted work:**  
[private] copyrighted work is the entire software repository named "Iran-DNS-Switcher", for which I am the [private] and copyright holder. The official repository is located at:  
https://github.com/mehrshadasgary/Iran-DNS-Switcher  
  
**2. The specific location of the infringing content:**  
The infringing content is the entire repository located at the following URL:  
https://github.com/imad-tech/Iran-DNS-Switcher  
  
**3. How the open-source license is being violated:**  
[private] project is released under the **GPL-3.0 License**, which explicitly requires that the original copyright notice and author attributions be preserved in all copies and derivative works. The infringing user has violated this core condition by deliberately removing [private] name, [private] copyright notice, and all attribution from the main `README.md` file. The `README.md` is the most prominent user-facing part of the software, and removing attribution from it directly violates the terms of the GPL-3.0 License.  
  
**4. What changes the user must make to comply with the license:**  
To bring the project into compliance with the license, the user must perform the following actions:  
a) Prominently restore [private] name ([private]) and a direct link to [private] original repository (https://github.com/mehrshadasgary/Iran-DNS-Switcher) at the top of their `README.md` file.  
b) Clearly state that their repository is a copy or a modified version of [private] original work, in accordance with the GPL-3.0 terms.  
  
**5. Why a full takedown is still the appropriate remedy:**  
Despite the theoretical path to compliance, I insist that a full takedown is the only appropriate remedy. The user's actions demonstrate a clear, malicious intent not to use the software in good faith, but to damage [private] original project's reputation and search visibility. This bad faith is proven by:  
a) Creating a single-purpose account solely for this infringement.  
b) Deliberately avoiding GitHub's "Fork" feature to sever the link to the original project.  
c) Connecting a bot to the repository that makes trivial, meaningless commits to the README file every few hours. This is not legitimate development; it is a clear, automated attempt to artificially "game" GitHub and Google's search algorithms, steal views, and suppress [private] original work.  
  
These actions show a clear intent to plagiarize and cause harm, not to contribute.  
  
**6. My contact information:**

Phone: [private]    
Email: [private]  
  
**7. Infringer's contact information:**

**8. Legal Declarations:**  
I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.  
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner.
