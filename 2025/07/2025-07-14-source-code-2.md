**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

[private] the [private] [private] and copyright holder of the code published in the GitHub repository https://github.com/Sharpiless/L2M. This code is the official implementation of [private] paper that has been accepted to [private]. [private] created and published this repository [private] and hold full copyright to the code and all related materials. No third party, including the user “chelseaaxy”, has been granted permission to copy, redistribute, or represent this work as their own or claim it as the official implementation.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original copyrighted work is a software repository hosted at https://github.com/Sharpiless/L2M, which contains the official implementation of a research paper [private] authored that was accepted to [private]. The repository includes original source code, model files, documentation (including the README), and project structure that were solely written and organized by [private]. This work is the result of original academic research and software development, and [private] published it publicly under an open source license with full attribution. All contents were created by [private] unless otherwise noted and constitute a unique and copyrighted contribution.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

https://github.com/Sharpiless/L2M

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/chelseaaxy/L2M

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The repository was intentionally made public on GitHub under an open-source license to encourage transparency and reproducibility in research. While there are no technological restrictions (such as DRM or encryption) preventing access, the project is clearly attributed to [private] as the original author. The repository includes authorship information, commit history, and proper licensing documentation. Any reuse or redistribution must comply with the license terms and should not misrepresent the authorship or claim to be the official implementation without permission.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The original project does not use any technological protection measures that restrict access, since it is published as an open-source research repository. Therefore, there are no protection measures to circumvent. However, the infringing project misrepresents authorship and falsely claims to be the official implementation, which violates the license and misleads users.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Based on the representative number of forks I have reviewed, I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository.**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

mit-license

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The original project is licensed under the MIT License, which requires that all copies or substantial portions of the Software retain the original copyright notice and license. The infringing repository (https://github.com/chelseaaxy/L2M) contains copied code from [private] repository (https://github.com/Sharpiless/L2M) but removes or fails to properly credit [private] as the original author. Additionally, the repository falsely claims to be the "official implementation" of the research, which is misleading and violates the spirit of the MIT License by misrepresenting authorship and origin.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

To bring the project into compliance with the MIT License, the infringing repository must:

Clearly attribute the original work by linking to https://github.com/Sharpiless/L2M in the README;

Restore and retain the original MIT license file and copyright notice;

Remove any false or misleading claims such as "official implementation", unless explicitly authorized;

Clearly indicate that the project is a fork or modified version, not the original source.

Alternatively, the repository should be made private or removed if these changes are not acceptable to the repository owner.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

The user appears to be newly registered and has not provided any public contact information on their GitHub profile. Additionally, they have disabled the Issues section on the infringing repository, making it impossible to reach them directly through GitHub. As a result, I do not have any means of contacting the alleged infringer.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
