To Whom It May Concern,

This is a follow-up DMCA takedown notice submitted pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(c), concerning additional infringing repositories discovered on GitHub. These repositories contain unauthorized copies, both direct and derivative, of proprietary source code previously removed by GitHub in response to an earlier DMCA complaint.

– Reference to Prior Takedown –  
The infringing material found in these repositories appears to be forked or derived from a repository that was previously taken down by GitHub under Ref No: [private], as publicly documented here:  
[private]  
That fork repository includes multiple unlicensed internal software projects obtained and distributed without permission, including:  

https://github.com/x2dh/skiid-Fiji-/tree/main/greed_old  
https://github.com/x2dh/skiid-Fiji-/tree/main/greed_rewrite  
https://github.com/x2dh/skiid-Fiji-/tree/main/emogir.ls  
https://github.com/x2dh/skiid-Fiji-/tree/main/evelina  
These materials are proprietary and were never made publicly available or licensed for any form of redistribution.

– Newly Identified Infringing Content –  
 https://github.com/81os/skiddydoo/tree/main/greed-kayo

This repository contains a very old version of the internal greed codebase. Although aged, this material still constitutes proprietary software that was never publicly licensed, and its continued presence on GitHub represents an ongoing violation of our right.  
– Good Faith Statement –  
We affirm in good faith that the use of the materials described above is unauthorized. These repositories host copyrighted content that was not published, licensed, or otherwise permitted for distribution.

– Statement Under Penalty of Perjury –  
We are the exclusive rights holders and/or authorized representatives of “Greed,” “EMOGIR.LS LLC,” and “Zelfur ONLINE SERVICES” (Zelfur.gg). Under penalty of perjury, we declare that the information provided in this notice is accurate and that the material identified herein is being used without permission and in violation of applicable copyright law.

We respectfully request that GitHub remove or disable access to the infringing repositories listed above and take any appropriate steps to limit further distribution.
