Microsoft Corporation is the exclusive owner of all rights, title, and interest in and to Minecraft. This includes all associated source code, binaries, assets, and related intellectual property protected under copyright and trademark law.

This notice is submitted by Tracer on behalf of Microsoft Corporation. Tracer is authorized to act on Microsoft’s behalf in matters involving the enforcement of its intellectual property rights, including the filing of DMCA takedown requests.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

To Whom It May Concern:

This is a formal notification under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). We are writing on behalf of Microsoft Corporation, the exclusive owner of the copyrights in the video game "Minecraft" (the "MINECRAFT Copyright"), found on Microsoft Corporation's official website at https://www.minecraft.net/.

We have a good faith belief that the repository located at the following URL contains material that infringes the MINECRAFT Copyright:

Infringing URL: https://github.com/DustyDel/EagsTestServer

Description of Infringing Material:

The repository "EagsTestServer" provides server software and related files (e.g., bungee.jar, server.jar within Protocol 335 and Protocol 340 directories, and associated configuration/script files) designed to run "Eaglercraft 1.12" and "1.12.2" servers. Eaglercraft is an unauthorized, fan-made recreation of Minecraft.

This content directly infringes upon Microsoft Corporation's intellectual property rights in the MINECRAFT Copyright because:

Unauthorized Distribution of Modified Server Software: The Minecraft End-User License Agreement (EULA), available at https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/eula, explicitly states: "Basically, Mods are okay to distribute; hacked versions or Modded Versions of the game client or server software are not okay to distribute." The server files provided in this repository constitute a "Modded Version" or "hacked version" of Minecraft server software, the distribution of which is expressly prohibited by the EULA.

Inclusion of Substantial Copyrighted Code/Content: Projects like Eaglercraft, which aim to replicate the core functionality and experience of Minecraft, inherently incorporate substantial portions of Microsoft Corporation's copyrighted code, assets, and intellectual property. The EULA clarifies that a "Mod" must be "something original that you or someone else created that doesn't contain a substantial part of our copyrightable code or content." The content in this repository, by enabling an unauthorized Minecraft-like experience, contains substantial copyrighted elements of Minecraft.

This unauthorized distribution damages the goodwill and reputation of Microsoft Corporation and causes confusion among consumers as to whether the Infringing Content is authorized, endorsed, or sponsored by Microsoft Corporation. Microsoft Corporation has an obligation to the public to police against any copyright infringing content which may cause marketplace confusion. Such actions dilute Microsoft Corporation’s MINECRAFT Copyright, harm its associated goodwill, and constitute, inter alia, a misappropriation and violation of the rights of Microsoft Corporation. This damage to its business entitles Microsoft Corporation to various forms of relief, including monetary compensation.

We represent under penalty of perjury that the information in this notice is true and accurate, and that we are authorized to act on behalf of Microsoft Corporation, the owner of the MINECRAFT Copyright. We have a good faith belief that the use of the Infringing Content in the aforementioned URL is not authorized by Microsoft Corporation as the copyright owner, its agent, or the law. Use of such Infringing Content in the URL is not defensible.

We request that you immediately disable or suspend access to the infringing repository at https://github.com/DustyDel/EagsTestServer without delay. We would appreciate your resolving this matter as soon as possible and confirming that you have done so within the next seven (7) days. Microsoft Corporation reserves the right to take whatever action it considers appropriate to protect its rights, and nothing contained in this Notice is intended to constitute a waiver of any of Microsoft Corporation’s legal rights or remedies, all of which are hereby expressly reserved.

Please let us know if you need any additional information.

Sincerely,

[private]  
The Tracer [private]
