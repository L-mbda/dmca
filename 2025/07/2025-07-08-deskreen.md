Hello GitHub Support,

I am the [private] of the project Deskreen, hosted at:
github.com/pavlobu/deskreen

Recently, I discovered that a user https://github.com/rozsazoltan has
copied [private] repository without forking it and is distributing it under a
different name at:
https://github.com/rozsazoltan/echoscreen

While AGPL-3.0 allows modification and redistribution, this user has
removed [private] name from the README file, which contained the original
license attribution:

"AGPL-3.0 License © [private]"

This violates Section 7 of AGPL-3.0, which explicitly states that
modifications must retain attribution notices. The user has replaced
[private] name with a generic mention of the source repository, but this does
not fulfill the requirements of the AGPL-3.0 license.

Violation Summary:
* Copied [private] repository without forking.
* Removed [private] name from the README and project attribution.
* Did not comply with AGPL-3.0 Section 7, which requires proper credit
to the original author.

I kindly request GitHub to take appropriate action to enforce
compliance, such as:

* Taking down the repository.

I was unable to contact the person directly.
The person was acting disrespectful and over [private] head in the infringed project community before.

Please let me know if you require any additional information.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,  
[private]
