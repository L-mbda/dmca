**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am an authorized representative of "TaiyitistMC", which owns the copyright to the software project "Taiyitist". I have been granted full authority to act on their behalf regarding copyright enforcement and DMCA takedown requests.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original copyrighted work is a software project named "Taiyitist", which [private] developed and published under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL-3.0). It is a modular Minecraft server plugin written in Java, consisting of multiple packages, classes, and utility modules. The project includes custom game logic, reflection-based mechanisms, patching systems, and event handling code designed for dynamic server customization.

The full source code was originally made publicly available at [https://github.com/Taiyitist/Taiyitist] and includes extensive documentation, comments, and original class structures authored by [private].

The infringing repository ("Silkard") contains identical or trivially modified versions of many of these original files. Changes are mostly limited to renaming classes and variables, while the logic, structure, and flow of the code remain substantially unchanged, indicating a derivative work that lacks attribution, license notice, or compliance with the GPL.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

https://github.com/Taiyitist/Taiyitist

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/MohistMC/Silkard

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

gnu-general-public-license-v3.0

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The infringing project ("Silkard") is a derivative of [private] original GPL-licensed project ("Taiyitist"). However, it violates the terms of the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL-3.0) in several ways:

No attribution: The repository provides no credit to the original "Taiyitist" project or its author.

No license notice: The required GPL license text is missing from the repository, along with any copyright notice.

No indication of modification: The repository does not state that it is a modified version or fork, which is required by GPL.

Obfuscation through superficial renaming: Class and file names have been changed, but the code logic, structure, and functionality are nearly identical to Taiyitist. This appears to be a deliberate attempt to conceal the code’s origin.

No source code disclosure (if binaries are distributed): If the project is distributed in binary or compiled form, the full corresponding source code must be provided under the GPL. This requirement has not been met.

These actions violate the GPL’s core principles of transparency, attribution, and copyleft. Therefore, I believe the license terms have been breached.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

Confirm that this project is a fork.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

The alleged infringer’s GitHub username is [private].

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
