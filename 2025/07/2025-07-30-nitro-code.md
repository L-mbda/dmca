2.1 Note:  
As of  July 20, 2025, [private] have deleted most contents of this repository. This is due to this exact issue of repeated instances of what I believe to be the same person, or group, reuploading [private] licensed and copyrighted content.

Published site: https://macbooksuck.xyz

6. Remedy Requested:  
 Please disable public access to the infringing repository at https://github.com/sjjdhdndbdbf/Vjv (and any GitHub Pages site or forks thereof) as you did for the prior complaint.
  
I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
