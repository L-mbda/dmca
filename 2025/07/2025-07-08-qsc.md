**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am submitting this complaint regarding a violation of the GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AGPLv3) by the repository and crate listed below:

-https://github.com/Quantum-Resistant-Cryptography/qrc-opensource-rs  
-Repository Name: qrc-opensource-rs  
-Maintained by: QRC Eurosmart SA (or related party)

Summary of Violations:

This project is almost entirely derived from code taken from an earlier version [2023] of the QSC Cryptographic Library, of which I am the [private] and copyright holder. This version of the QSC library was released under the AGPLv3 license and is hosted at: https://github.com/QRCS-CORP/QSC

Specifically, the qrc-opensource-rs project:  
Violates the terms of the original license, with, in addition to AGPL, clearly states a 'no copy' and 'no reproduction' clause in every implementation header.  
Copies original function-level logic and documentation from an older AGPLv3 version of [private] library,  
The function API, help documentation, library layout, file names, all an exact match for [private] library, it is an obvious rip of [private] work, that appears to be a GPT translation of [private] work to Rust almost verbatim.  
The API naming, function logic, original primitives, they even ripped the function help documentation on the page description from [private] protocol descriptions.

The original headers have a 'no copy' and 'no commercial use' clauses on top of the AGPL license.  
The actions of the parties involved violates the license, and the repository is an unlawful reproduction.

Aside from their violation of copy, and their stated intent to use this copy for commercial purposes, they are also in violation of several AGPL rules:  
-Omits any attribution or link to [private] as the author of the source library  
-Replaces license headers with a false copyright  
-Provides no reference to the original repository or license lineage  
-Publishes the crate on crates.io as if it is proprietary  
-Are advertising this on LinkedIn and other websites as original work.

This is a clear violation of AGPLv3 Sections 4–5 and 13, which require:  
-Full attribution of authorship,  
-Preservation of original license notices,  
-Public access to modified source (especially if used in network-accessible systems).  

I am willing to provide commit histories, side-by-side diffs, and original source records upon request, but a simple visual comparison will immediately identify this as an obvious copy of [private] work.  
This is probably one of the most blatant rips of copyright that I have ever seen (and [private] have been writing open-source code for more than 30 years). This person's actions border on criminal IP theft. If it were up to me, their account would be revoked, and they would be banned from the platform.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The project is the QSC cryptographic library: https://github.com/QRCS-CORP/QSC  
The version is the last AGPL version before the license was changed to a proprietary license model in 2023.  
It has its lineage on GitHub, developed for nearly 7 years.  

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

https://github.com/QRCS-CORP/QSC

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/Quantum-Resistant-Cryptography/qrc-opensource-rs

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

gnu-affero-general-public-license-v3.0

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

Every license header in the code they ripped has a clause that states:

[private]

link: https://github.com/QRCS-CORP/QSC/commit/111dad513c7d30e58888d394db52bdf900974880#diff-970fcf64c1af475ef11d82ca1017e3ad5df0fcec725dfe6687b66eba1f552342

They are also in violation of a number of AGPL clauses:  
-Omits any attribution or link to [private] as the author of the source library  
-Replaces license headers with a false copyright  
-Provides no reference to the original repository or license lineage  
-Publishes the crate on crates.io as if it is proprietary  
-Are advertising this on [private] and other websites as original work.  

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

This repository is in violation of the no copy, no redistribution clause of the QSC license, and multiple AGPL violations, and must be removed.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**
