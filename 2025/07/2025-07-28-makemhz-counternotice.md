**Are you the owner of the content that has been disabled, or authorized to act on the owner’s behalf?**

Yes, I am the content owner.

**Please describe the nature of your content ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter Notice.

I am the [private] [private] of the code and was made as a replacement to a utility called [private] which triggers many virus warnings and wanted to create a clean alternative.

The tool is just a mix of a FTP client and IRC client. The tool connects to IRC client to obtain temporary ftp credentials and then lets user browse files. The tool in itself just makes the process easier than having to manually do the steps..

**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/team-Resurgent/Pandora

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

I believe this is a mistake and Pandora is just a ftp client with IRC built in, this would be the same as DMCA'ing all ftp/irc clients such as [private] and [private].The tool is just a utility to make downloading of archived files easy. It would also be the same as DMCA'ing web browsers just because a user could download something illegal.

I have discussed with [private] aka [private] in 2 instances that PrometheOS does not contain any of his code

[private]

and also addressed another issue of attribution in the same repo.

I hereby would reject this DMCA and claim it to be a false claim, and feel it is a targeted attack.

Kind Regards
