Narrative of Infringement  
Copying & Attribution Removal (21 May–14 July): Within 24 hours of forking, the infringer replaced the CATL license header with their own name, then deleted it entirely and retroactively applied a false Apache-2.0 license.  
Commercialization (23 May–15 July): Ads.txt swaps, multi-network ads, Google Analytics integration.

Evidence Index  
Exhibit A: Fork lineage banner (repository metadata)  
Exhibit B: License owner edit (commit 11568ba)  
Exhibit C: First ads.txt swap (commit 7ae8b14)  
Exhibit D: Ads-network expansion (commits 543f963, 18ec26e, 45c3225)  
Exhibit G: License deletion (commit 1d97a16)  
Exhibit H: Apache-2.0 insertion (commit 95f1072)  
Exhibit  I:  Ad-laden HTML injection (commit 6b2f648)  

Willful Infringement & Statutory Standards  
Knowledge & Intent: Deletion of the original license and self-licensing demonstrate deliberate intent.  
Commercial Gain: Insertion of ad networks and analytics for profit.  
Attribution Removal: Owner field changed and then wiped.  
Continued Distribution: Despite a cease-and-desist sent July 13, the infringer persisted.  
These factors constitute “red flags” under 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(1)(A)(ii) and satisfy the willful threshold for enhanced statutory damages under 17 U.S.C. § 504(c)(2).

Requested Remedies  
Primary Claim: Unauthorized reproduction and public distribution of CATL-licensed code (§ 106).  
Aggravators: License stripping, commercialization.  
Requested Action: Remove or delete the repository at https://github.com/fdfdsfadf/Cat-nitro-with-chat-room.
