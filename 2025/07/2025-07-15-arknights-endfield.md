**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

We are the original creator of the computer software for the game "Arknights: Endfield", which includes all source code, executable files, and related documentation. The software was independently developed by us and qualifies as an original work protected under copyright law. We retain exclusive ownership of all rights, including reproduction, distribution, and creation of derivative works.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

Arknights: Endfield is a real-time 3D RPG with strategic elements. It includes original source code, executable files, and related assets.
The repository in question contains unauthorized parsed and extracted game data to which we hold the copyright, including but not limited to character models, textures, animations, art assets, audio files, and configuration scripts. The repository operator is reproducing and distributing our copyrighted materials without permission. This act also facilitates the creation of derivative works and unauthorized modifications, as third parties can directly access and alter our proprietary content. Furthermore, the reverse‑engineering process used to extract these assets violates our exclusive rights to control copying, distribution, adaptation, and public display of the work.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

Please see our official website: https://endfield.gryphline.com/en-us/.

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/PotRooms/EndFieldData  
https://github.com/Campofinale/EndFieldData-Archive

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Our game implements multiple technical measures to safeguard our game assets, including:  
- Asset encryption and obfuscation.  
- Bundled proprietary file formats to prevent unauthorized access.  
- Runtime integrity verification to detect tampering or unauthorized extraction.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The decrypted asset files in the infringing repository were extracted using reverse‑engineering tools, bypassing our encryption keys and disabling signature verification. The infringer has defeated our technical safeguards and made our protected materials freely available, and enabled unauthorized extraction and distribution of in-game content. This constitutes a clear violation of copyright under the DMCA.
