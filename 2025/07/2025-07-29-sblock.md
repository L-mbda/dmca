**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

We are the original developers and rightful copyright owners of the software published as SBlock - Super Ad Blocker, which is publicly available on the Chrome Web Store. Our team created and maintains this project, including its source code, assets, and branding. No part of it has been released under an open-source license or made publicly available for reuse. We have not authorized any third party to copy, distribute, or publish this work elsewhere.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original copyrighted work is a browser extension titled SBlock - Super Ad Blocker, available on the Chrome Web Store at the following link:

https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/sblock-super-ad-blocker/cmdgdghfledlbkbciggfjblphiafkcgg

This extension includes proprietary code, design elements, logic for ad-blocking functionality, and unique branding developed entirely by our team. The extension was built from scratch and is actively maintained. We have not published its source code or granted any permission for duplication, modification, or redistribution.

The infringing repository on GitHub contains unauthorized copies of our code structure, logic, and functionality, which were not made available for public use, reuse, or modification.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/sblock-super-ad-blocker/cmdgdghfledlbkbciggfjblphiafkcgg

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing 

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Our software is distributed exclusively through the Chrome Web Store in a compiled and minified format, which prevents direct access to the original source code. The Chrome Web Store platform acts as a technological barrier by not exposing the full, readable code to the public. Additionally, we do not host the source code on any public repositories or websites, and access to the development files is restricted to our internal team. These measures help prevent unauthorized copying, extraction, or redistribution of our copyrighted material.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project directly copied our entire extension and pasted it into a public GitHub repository without permission. This includes our proprietary code, structure, and functionality. The infringer did not attempt to modify or reverse-engineer the software — they simply took the complete packaged project and uploaded it to GitHub, bypassing the Chrome Web Store’s protection by manually extracting and publishing our copyrighted material.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
