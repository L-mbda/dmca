Description of the copyrighted work:  
The repository above contains the source code of our proprietary CRM system, “Broom Service.” This system was developed over several years and includes sensitive business logic, internal workflows, and interfaces specific to the operations of my company.

This is a direct violation of my copyright and business confidentiality.
