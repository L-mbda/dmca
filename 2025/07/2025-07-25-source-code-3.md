**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The repository has copied significant portions of [private] original project, including script logic, structure, terminal interface design, and README content. However, it has removed all attribution to [private] as the original author, and has not included the Apache 2.0 license file or any mention of the original source, which is a direct violation of the license terms.  
Additionally, the infringer had joined our [private] development group where [private] [private] an [private] and the original [private] of the project. He had asked technical questions about [private] project and was clearly aware of [private] authorship. Later, he publicly promoted his own copy of the project (without attribution) in the same group. This clearly shows that he was fully aware of the origin of the code and acted in bad faith by removing all attribution and license information.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**
