**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am an [private] for our company's GitHub application. I am part of the team that owns and maintains [private]. Our team has received a service ticket from the team that manages the application this code belongs to. The request was to have the repo transferred to our org or deleted as they say their attempts to do so have not been successful. A former employee made this repo in their account instead of inside the organiztion.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

This repository was created and maintained in a users personal public repository but it contains Sherwin-Williams application code. It should have been created inside of our organization. We have rules that try to contain users within our org but they can still create a public repo under their own account as they did here. They then left the company and say they are are unable to delete or transfer the repo after many attempts.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Other Change

we need this repo either deleted or transferred to our [private] organization so that we can handle it.. We have already cloned and recreated the repo in our org.
