**Are you the owner of the content that has been disabled, or authorized to act on the owner’s behalf?**

Yes, I am the content owner.

**Please describe the nature of your content ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am one of [private] [private] of all code and other materials produced under the ‘[private]’ GitHub organization as part of the [private] ([private]). By mutual agreement among the [private] team members, every line of code—frontend and backend alike—is jointly owned regardless of who committed it. Although [private] [private] authored most of the backend code (as evidenced in our Git history), and did not directly push frontend files [private], those frontend contributions are nevertheless covered by our shared-ownership agreement. No portion of the code has ever been assigned or licensed to any third party, and I am fully authorized to assert our collective ownership and request reinstatement of the repository.

**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire contents of both repositories were disabled. Here are their URLs:

https://github.com/Yonesj/unico-frontend  
https://github.com/Yonesj/unico-backend

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

Although I was later removed as a collaborator from the ‘[private]’ GitHub organization, that action only revoked my access—it did not transfer or terminate my underlying copyright ownership in any way. As one of [private] [private] of all code and materials produced for the [private] ([private]), [private] have shared ownership over both frontend and backend repositories and at no point did I sign any agreement—verbal or written—assigning my rights in the jointly-owned code to any individual or entity.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**

**Please confirm that you have you have read our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Counter Notice</a>.**
