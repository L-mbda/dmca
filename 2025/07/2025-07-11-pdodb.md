**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and [private] of the original PDOdb class, which is a custom PDO-based database wrapper developed as a fully compatible and secure replacement for ThingEngineer's MysqliDb. All source code was written [private] by [private] under the namespace decMuc\PDOdb. [private] have never authorized any individual to republish, clone, or misrepresent[private] code as their own.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original copyrighted work is a PHP-based database abstraction layer [private] developed from scratch, named PDOdb and published under the namespace decMuc\PDOdb. It is a modern rewrite of the general concept behind ThingEngineer's MysqliDb library, but built entirely on PHP’s native PDO extension.

While the overall method structure (e.g. getOne(), insert(), join()) was inspired by the original MysqliDb, the entire implementation was written by [private]. This includes [private] own PDO-based logic, internal structure, JOIN and subquery handling, strict WHERE-type filters (like whereInt() and whereBool()), as well as the security validator for GROUP BY and ORDER BY expressions.

All files, functions, documentation, examples, and the README were created and authored [private] by [private]. The implementation contains significant original intellectual effort and is clearly distinct from the original MysqliDb, both in design and in technical execution.

The codebase has been publicly available at https://github.com/decMuc/PDOdb, with full commit history demonstrating authorship and publication timeline.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

https://github.com/decMuc/PDOdb

This is the official and original repository for the decMuc\PDOdb project. It includes the full source code, commit history, issue discussions, and documentation — all of which clearly establish [private] authorship, the timeline of development, and the originality of the work. The repository has been public and continuously maintained since its initial release.

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/Shail4881/PDOdb

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

mit-license

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The user has copied the majority of [private] repository (https://github.com/decMuc/PDOdb), including core structure, methods, internal logic, and documentation – but falsely presents it as their own original work.

While a license header from [private] code is still present in one file, the repository:

does not credit [private] (the original author) in the README, project description, or repository name

does not state that it is a fork or derived work

does not include the full MIT license or attribution notice as required by the license

falsely implies that the user is the creator of the code and concept

This violates the conditions of the MIT license, which explicitly requires preservation of the copyright and license notice in all copies or substantial portions of the software.

Furthermore, the user has:

locked Issues and removed references to the original project to suppress visibility and mislead users

deliberately included incorrect usage examples in the README (e.g. calling $db->select() which does not exist in the original or in [private] rewrite), which creates the impression that the codebase is broken or incomplete

This is a misuse of open source licensing and undermines both the intent of the MIT license and the reputation of the original project.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

To bring the project into compliance with the MIT license, the repository owner must clearly state in the README and project description that the repository is based on or derived from https://github.com/decMuc/PDOdb. Additionally, the original author’s name ("[private]") must be included in a visible and appropriate location, such as the README or a dedicated credits section. All source files that originate from the original project must retain the full MIT license header, including the correct copyright line and license URL. Furthermore, the repository should not be presented as an original creation; if it is a fork or derivative, this must be explicitly stated. Misleading or inaccurate information in the README – such as references to non-existent functions like $db->select() – should be corrected to reflect the actual capabilities of the code. If these requirements cannot or will not be fulfilled, the repository should be made private to prevent further confusion or misuse. These actions are necessary to comply with the conditions of the MIT license and to uphold transparency and fairness within the open source community.
