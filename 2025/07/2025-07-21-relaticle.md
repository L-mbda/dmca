**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

gnu-general-public-license-v3.0

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The AGPL-3.0 license is being violated in multiple ways:

1. **Missing Attribution (Section 4)**: The repository contains no acknowledgment that it is based on or derived from Relaticle. The AGPL-3.0 requires prominent attribution to the original work and copyright holders.

2. **No License Text (Section 4)**: The repository does not include the AGPL-3.0 license text or any reference to the original license terms under which the work was provided.

3. **No Source Code Disclosure (Section 13)**: While the GitHub repository is public, the associated website ([private]) appears to be offering the software as a service without providing users access to the complete corresponding source code as required by AGPL-3.0's network copyleft provisions.

4. **Failure to Indicate Changes (Section 5)**: The work has been modified (rebranding, name changes) but contains no notices indicating what changes were made to the original work, as required by the license.

5. **Misrepresentation of Authorship**: The project is being presented as original work rather than a derivative of Relaticle, which violates the spirit and requirements of the AGPL-3.0 license.

6. **No Copyright Notices**: The original copyright notices have been removed or replaced without maintaining attribution to the original author as required.

These violations constitute both license non-compliance and copyright infringement, as the AGPL-3.0 license grants permission to use the work only when its terms are followed.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

To bring the project into AGPL-3.0 license compliance, the following changes must be made:

1. **Add Prominent Attribution**: Include clear attribution to Relaticle as the original work in the README, documentation, and website, stating "Based on Relaticle by [private] (https://relaticle.com)"

2. **Include Original License**: Add the complete AGPL-3.0 license text to the repository and ensure all original copyright notices are preserved alongside any new ones.

3. **Provide Modification Notice**: Clearly document all changes made to the original Relaticle codebase with dates and descriptions of modifications as required by AGPL-3.0 Section 5.

4. **Source Code Availability**: Ensure complete source code (including any modifications) is readily available to all users of the telis.dev service, with clear instructions for access as required by AGPL-3.0 Section 13.

5. **License Propagation**: Ensure the entire derivative work is licensed under AGPL-3.0 with proper license headers in source files.

6. **Website Compliance**: Update the [private] website to include attribution, license information, and source code access as required for network use under AGPL-3.0.

However, given the wholesale copying without permission and the apparent intent to present this as original work rather than a derivative, I believe complete removal of the infringing repository is the most appropriate remedy. The violations appear willful and the scope of copying constitutes copyright infringement beyond mere license non-compliance.
