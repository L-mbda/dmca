**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] [private] and sole copyright owner of the "EXM Premium Utility" software, which is part of [private] EXM Tweaks product line. [private] [private] developed and distributed this software through [private] official website - https://exmtweaks.com, and I have not authorized any third parties to reproduce, distribute, or modify it. As such, I have full legal authority to request removal of infringing copies.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The copyrighted work in question is a proprietary software product titled EXM Premium Tweaking Utility, developed and owned by [private] company, EXM Tweaks S.R.O. This software is a paid Windows utility distributed exclusively through our official website: https://exmtweaks.com. [private] [private] the [private] [private] and legal copyright holder.

There are two GitHub repositories that contain unauthorized and infringing copies of this software:

1. https://github.com/zerofishy/ExmPremium-Crack/blob/main/EXMPremiumTweaker.bat  
This file contains a cracked and unauthorized copy of an older version of EXM Premium Tweaking Utility. The original was protected using a batch code obfuscation tool, making it unreadable and difficult to reverse-engineer. The version shared in this repository has had those protections bypassed, exposing the logic and allowing redistribution without permission. This violates both copyright law and anti-circumvention provisions under the DMCA.

2. https://github.com/exhaustivee/EXMCRACKED  
This repository contains leaked source code and partial components from the current paid version of EXM Premium Tweaking Utility. It includes:

Source and project files in: https://github.com/Exmtweaks/Exmtweakpremium/tree/main/Exm%20Free%20Virson%20Crack

An archive containing additional content: https://github.com/Exmtweaks/Exmtweakpremium/blob/main/Exm%20Free%20Virson%20Crack.7z

None of this code has ever been open-sourced or publicly licensed. Publishing or distributing these files constitutes a clear violation of my intellectual property rights and creates security risks for users who may unknowingly download modified or malicious versions of the software.

Both repositories are unauthorized and infringe upon the exclusive rights held by EXM Tweaks S.R.O. We respectfully request immediate removal.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

EXM Premium Tweaking Utility - https://exmtweaks.com/product/exmtweaks-premium

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

Specific files within the repository are infringing

**Identify only the specific file URLs within the repository that is infringing:**

https://github.com/zerofishy/ExmPremium-Crack/blob/main/EXMPremiumTweaker.bat

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

For the older version of [private] program (EXM Premium Tweaking Utility), the batch code was protected using heavy code obfuscation, which rendered the code completely unreadable to human users. This obfuscation was intentionally implemented to prevent reverse engineering, modification, or duplication of the software by unauthorized users. Without extreme effort and advanced tooling, the logic and function of the software remained inaccessible, thereby effectively controlling unauthorized access and redistribution.

For the current version of [private] software (leaked in another GitHub repository), [private] have implemented a hardware-bound license key system (HWID locking). Each copy of the program is securely tied to a unique hardware ID, and only users with a valid license key issued by my server can activate and use the software. This system ensures that:

Only paying customers are able to access the software's core functionality.

Sharing or copying the software between different machines is not possible without breaking the protection.

These technical measures serve as effective access controls, and the presence of cracked, deobfuscated, or source-leaked versions on GitHub represents a clear circumvention of these protections, in violation of DMCA §1201.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused GitHub repositories contain files that intentionally bypass or remove the protective mechanisms [private] implemented in both the older and newer versions of [private] software:

In the case of the repository at  
"https://github.com/zerofishy/ExmPremium-Crack/blob/main/EXMPremiumTweaker.bat",  
the uploaded ".bat" file is a cracked and deobfuscated version of my original, heavily obfuscated batch script. The obfuscation was a technical protection measure used to prevent users from reading, copying, or modifying the code. This cracked version circumvents that protection, making the logic visible and executable by anyone, in clear violation of DMCA anti-circumvention provisions.

In the repository at  
https://github.com/exhaustivee/EXMCRACKED,  
including subdirectories like  
"https://github.com/Exmtweaks/Exmtweakpremium/tree/main/Exm%20Free%20Virson%20Crack",  
and archive files such as  
"https://github.com/Exmtweaks/Exmtweakpremium/blob/main/Exm%20Free%20Virson%20Crack.7z",
the authors have uploaded partial source code and internal files from [private] current paid version, which uses a hardware-bound license key (HWID locking) system to prevent unauthorized usage. By publicly distributing these components and bypassing the license validation process, the accused repository directly circumvents the technical access control in place, allowing unauthorized users to run or alter the software without a valid key.

These actions clearly constitute the circumvention of technological protection measures, as defined under 17 U.S.C. §1201, and I respectfully request removal of the infringing content.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
