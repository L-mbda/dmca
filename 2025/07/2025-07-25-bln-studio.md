Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] copyright owner of the original RedM script developed under BLN Studio. The work was created by [private]/[private], never authorized for public distribution. [private] hold exclusive rights under copyright law (U.S. Title 17 Â§ 106).

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original work is a proprietary RedM script (FiveM/RedM framework) developed for commercial sale. Key elements include:  
- Lua script architecture for in-game systems  
- Unique features: Filter system, draw sprite, 8-slot menu with submenus, disable/lock items, emotes system...etc  
- Sold exclusively via Tebex under encrypted/escrowed terms prohibiting redistribution.  
The infringing material is a derivative work: minimally modified (variable renaming/comment changes) but structurally identical to my original code. Evidence includes:  
1. Near-identical functionality demonstrated in his [private] video ([private]) vs. my official demo ([private])  
2. Code similarity confirmed via file structure, logic flow, and asset dependencies.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

Original work (accessible to [private] [private] only):

Additional proof of ownership:  
- Tebex store page: `https://bln.tebex.io/`  
- BLN Studio official channel: `[private]`

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/dolaji-op/RedM-Radial-Menu

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The copyrighted work is protected by industry-standard AES-256 encryption deployed through Tebex.io's escrow system.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The infringer illegally bypassed technological measures by:

1. Reverse-engineering the encrypted bytecode to extract source logic  
2. Stripping license checks from the runtime environment  
3. Repackaging core functionality with superficial changes (renamed variables/comments)  
4. Distributing decrypted source publicly - the very outcome the protections prevent  
This constitutes willful circumvention under DMCA Â§ 1201(b)(1), as evidenced by:  
- Identical functionality despite claimed 'rewrites'  
- Preservation of proprietary architecture (filter system, disable/lock items, 8-slot menu with submenus, emotes system!..etc)  
- Demonstrated access to commercial-only features in their ;pt demo

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No
