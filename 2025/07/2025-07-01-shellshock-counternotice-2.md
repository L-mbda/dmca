Dear GitHub Legal Team,  


[private] the owner and publisher of the repository titled "StateFarmClient" available at the main repository at [private] and its fork at https://github.com/Hydroflame522/StateFarmClient. In this Counter-Notice I am writing on behalf of [private] and the rest of the [private].


The takedown request submitted to us is not only wholly incorrect, it is also frivolous and unprofessional, following a string of similar reports containing blatant lies despite the claims in the report supposedly being “under penalty of perjury”. In response, this is our formal DMCA Counter-Notice regarding the takedown request submitted by [private]. We believe this takedown is a false claim, as our script does not infringe on any copyrighted materials owned by [private]. 


1. No Copyrighted Code or Assets Used

Our script is entirely original and does not include any proprietary code, images, logos, or UI elements from Shell Shockers. See the up-to-date repository containing our script: https://github.com/Hydroflame522/StateFarmClient. The statement that the entire repository is infringing is completely false, as all code and assets are developed and created by the [private]. No files in the repository are or ever have been based on [private] copyright works.

2. Alleged “Deobfuscation and Circumvention”

The DMCA only forbids bypassing mechanisms that “effectively control access to” copyrighted works. StateFarm Client on its own does not enable access to the copyrighted material of Shell Shockers. Shell Shockers has no mechanisms to control access to the game and copyrighted works, as anyone with a web browser can freely access Shell Shockers, regardless of whether or not they have StateFarm Client installed.


3. Misuse of DMCA

DMCA §1201 Misuse

The claim wrongly cites DMCA §1201, which applies only for technological protection measures (TPMs) such as DRM or various methods of encryption. Shell Shockers is a web-based game where all JavaScript is delivered client-side to the user. When compared to precedent, StateFarm Client acts in a very similar way to the Game Genie that was found to be free of infringement in Lewis Galoob Toys, Inc. v. Nintendo of America, Inc. The Game Genie was a device that could be placed in between NES cartridges and the NES to modify small sections of the data going to the system from the cartridge, such as values that represented the player’s health. The script acts in essentially the same way as it merely intercepts and modifies game code to activate or disable certain functionality, such as removing the code that displays ads. No “concrete or permanent derivative work”, the standard found in Galoob for infringement, is created or ever has been by the script, as the modifications are applied per-user locally each time someone uses their web browser to access Shell Shockers.


DMCA Misuse for Monetization Enforcement

The claim that our script “disables monetization” is not only ludicrous but also is not a valid basis for a DMCA takedown request. Monetization systems, including the “advertising and analytics systems” mentioned are not considered copyrighted material and are not subject to DMCA protections. Users blocking advertisements or alterations of client-sided JavaScript does not constitute copyright infringement. These misuses suggest a lack of research and an attempt to exploit DMCA protections for improper enforcement of monetization systems.


4. Fair Use & Independent Development

Our script is an independently developed modification tool that does not copy or distribute Shell Shockers’ source code or assets whatsoever. Usage of the tool is by user discretion only and intended for educational purposes.


I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter Notice. Given the information above, I request that this report be dismissed. In compliance with the DMCA, I provide the following statement:  


I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled. I consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.


Sincerely,

[private]
