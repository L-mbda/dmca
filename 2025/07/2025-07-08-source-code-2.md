**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and copyright holder of the source code in question. This repository was previously reported by [private] via a DMCA request due to copyright infringement, which was confirmed by GitHub, resulting in the removal of the infringing content.

However, the same person has cloned and published the repository again without [private] consent, replicating the same content that was already subject to removal for violating [private] rights. This recurrence constitutes a clear violation of GitHub policies and [private] rights as an [private]. I again request that this duplicate content be removed and appropriate action be taken against this repeated behavior.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original work is a complete sales project that [private] have [private] developed. It consists of a full stack web application implemented with Node.js in the backend, its own authentication module (auth), and a user interface developed with Vue.js. All the code was written by [private], including the architecture, routes, models, controllers, business logic, as well as the frontend structure and design. I have not authorized any other person to use, copy, clone or publish this project in any repository, and all intellectual property belongs exclusively to [private].
