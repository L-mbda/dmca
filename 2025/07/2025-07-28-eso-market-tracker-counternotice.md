This is a public repository that contains a list of item names that my project consumes elsewhere. I use this to power a fuzzy search for a tool on [private] [private]: [private].

These item names are all gathered from a third-party website. This is their main page: [private].

The complainant claims:  
- These item names are sourced from their private service, which is untrue. I have provided my source above.  
- These files copy "core logic, formatting, and design patterns that were developed originally for ESO Market Tracker," which is untrue. These files are just lists of alphabetized item names from [private] video game.  
- "Includes, in its commit history, a file named TSCPriceNameData.lua (see this commit) which is a direct representation of proprietary data sourced from my project," which is untrue. To the best of my knowledge, the only files in the repository are the two listed above. My commits to this repository have only been to add newly sourced item names from my source above.
