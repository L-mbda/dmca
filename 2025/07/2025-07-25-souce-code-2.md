I am the [private] and [private] [private]

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The copyrighted work is a custom web application (an Angular-based platform) that implements and manages the draft (“pick/ban”) process for the video game Bullet Echo. [private] developed this application privately for [private] [private] use and for a future website [private] plan to launch. The legitimate version was previously deployed by [private] via [private] from [private] [private] [private]; [private] periodically committed production updates there (the commit history shows a chronological sequence of [private] authored updates).

The infringing repository’s maintainers downloaded the entire codebase as of June 29, 2025 from [private] deployment and uploaded it to their public repository without [private] consent. However, [private] claim concerns specifically the file main-XG5HCOCS.js, as it embodies [private] unique intellectual contribution and commercial value. They are using it in connection with a Bullet Echo tournament and other commercial or promotional activities without [private] permission. [private] [private] never granted them a license (express or implied), nor do [private] have any contractual, employment, or collaborative relationship with them. The software was not created under any contract, engagement, or commission, and no transfer of rights has occurred.

[private] retain the full original source code (all modules, components, services, configuration, and original commit history) evidencing [private] authorship. The legitimate version of the same file—corresponding to commit `[private]` in [private]—is available here: [private].

[private] created the code on [private] personal equipment, outside any employment relationship. No open-source license was ever granted for the infringing version.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**
