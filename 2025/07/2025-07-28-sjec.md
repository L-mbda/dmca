I am one of the [private] to the official website for TIARA 2024, the annual tech fest of St Joseph Engineering College (SJEC). The website was developed collaboratively by the student team under the guidance and ownership of the college and GDSC SJEC.

All code, design, and content were developed specifically for this event, and the intellectual property belongs to St Joseph Engineering College and its organizing committee. I am authorized to act on behalf of the institution in this matter.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The users has copied our entire repository including structure, codebase, design, components, and even team data, while removing the .git directory to hide the source history.

He/they falsely claims to have built the website "fully from scratch" and has slightly modified text and logos, while the majority of the code and structure remain unchanged.

This can be verified through visual comparison and source inspection. For example:

Their team section: [private]

The content still showcases our collegeâ€™s actual team names, which further proves that the material was directly copied without any attribution or consent.

Additionally, the copied work was used to market and conduct an actual college event under the name "Sanskriti 2K25" using the infringing website:

Their vercel deployment also reflects the copied code:

The violation includes:

2. Misrepresentation of authorship

3. Public and commercial display without permission
