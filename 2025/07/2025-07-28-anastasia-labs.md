No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] of the copyright owner, Anastasia Labs.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original copyrighted work is a TypeScript software development kit (SDK) named lucid-evolution, developed and maintained by Anastasia Labs, a software R&D company. The SDK was originally hosted at [private] and represents proprietary work authored by employees of Anastasia Labs, under direction of the company.

It was published under the MIT License, with the correct copyright attribution:  
`Copyright (c) 2025 Anastasia Labs`

The codebase includes unique logic, documentation, and architectural decisions created exclusively by Anastasia Labs [private]. Internal version control and repository history from our [private] [private] provide further proof of original authorship and publication prior to the unauthorized fork.

A former employee, [private] ([private]: [private]), unlawfully transferred this repository to a newly created organization, no-witness-labs, without permission and changed the license to falsely reflect a new copyright:

`Copyright (c) 2025 No Witness Labs`

This removal and replacement of license attribution constitutes a clear violation of the terms of the MIT license and copyright law.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

The original commit is present in the repo:  
https://github.com/no-witness-labs/evolution-sdk/commit/8760867702dde1f4a9b84f387a1b18c958e6c0c5

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/no-witness-labs/evolution-sdk

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

mit-license

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The repository at https://github.com/no-witness-labs/evolution-sdk is a direct copy of software originally developed and published by Anastasia Labs under the MIT License. This license grants permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute the software, but only if the following conditions are met:

The original copyright notice must remain.

The full license text must be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software.

The original author attribution must not be removed or replaced.

The individual who copied this code, [private] [private], violated all of these terms by:

Removing the original copyright

r  
Copy  
Edit  
Copyright (c) 2025 Anastasia Labs  
Replacing it with a false attribution:

yaml  
Copy  
Edit  
Copyright (c) 2025 No Witness Labs  
This action is not permitted under the MIT License. The license is not transferable in this way and does not allow someone to claim authorship or ownership of code they did not create.

By doing this, the individual:

Voided the license that permitted any reuse

Breached copyright law

Distributed infringing material, as the entire repository is now falsely attributed

Therefore, the current repository is operating without a valid license, and all files within it are considered unauthorized, infringing copies of Anastasia Labs' intellectual property.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

To bring the project into compliance with the MIT license and applicable copyright law, the following changes must be made:

Restore the Original License File  
Reinstate the full, unmodified MIT License with the original attribution:  
Copyright (c) 2025 Anastasia Labs

Restore Proper Attribution  
The repository must clearly state that the codebase originates from Anastasia Labs. This includes:

Retaining any author-level copyright notices

Adding a note in the README (or similarly prominent location) stating:

“This code was originally developed by Anastasia Labs and published as lucid-evolution.”

Cease False Attribution  
All references to “No Witness Labs” as the original creator or copyright holder of the code must be removed.

Migrate the Repository Back to Anastasia Labs  
This is a required step to remain in compliance. This was not a normal fork or derivative work — the repository was directly migrated from the Anastasia Labs [private] [private] without permission by a former employee.
This act constitutes a transparent effort to rebrand and falsely claim ownership of company property.

For the license and copyright to remain valid:  
The repository must be returned to its original home under the Anastasia Labs organization.  
If No Witness Labs wishes to build upon the code, they may fork the repository with attribution, as permitted under the license.

Ensure No Further Distribution Under Misrepresentation  
Any further public use, distribution, or marketing of this software under the No Witness Labs name — without correcting the above — constitutes a continued license violation and copyright infringement.
