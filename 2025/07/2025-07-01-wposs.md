**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

[private] a [private] of World POS Solutions (WPOSS), the rightful owner of the proprietary source code and related materials that have been published without authorization. The content in question includes original source code, internal documentation such as release notes, and embedded references to our corporate domain (wposs). These assets were developed entirely by our internal engineering team and are part of our private and confidential technology stack. No license or permission has ever been granted to the third party to reproduce, publish, or share this material on GitHub or elsewhere.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original copyrighted work consists of proprietary source code and documentation developed by World POS Solutions (WPOSS) as part of our electronic payment platform and Android POS terminal solutions. This includes custom-developed modules, integrations with our backend services, and code containing business logic specific to our operations. The infringing repository also includes internal documents such as release_notes.md, as well as multiple references to our official domain (wposs) embedded throughout the codebase. These materials are part of our internal development assets and were never released to the public or licensed for third-party use. The unauthorized publication of this content on GitHub constitutes a clear and deliberate infringement of our copyright.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

The original work is not publicly available online. It is proprietary software developed and maintained internally by World POS Solutions (WPOSS).

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Yes. The source code and related documentation are stored in private repositories and internal systems managed by World POS Solutions (WPOSS). Access to these materials is restricted through user authentication, access control policies, and internal security protocols. No authorization was given to publish or distribute this content publicly.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

While the accused project does not use hacking, reverse engineering, or break encryption, it effectively circumvents our organizational and technical protection measures by disclosing proprietary code and internal documentation without authorization. This content was originally stored in access-controlled environments such as private repositories and internal servers, protected by authentication and internal policy restrictions. Publishing this material on GitHub without permission bypasses those protections and exposes controlled intellectual property to the public.

Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**
