**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and [private] of United Tech and Solutions, the company that developed the original software project in question. All code, designs, and related materials were created by our internal development team under [private] direction and remain the exclusive intellectual property of our company. I am fully authorized to act on behalf of United Tech and Solutions regarding copyright matters, including submitting this takedown notice.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original copyrighted work is a proprietary software project developed by United Tech and Solutions, titled “United Tech and Solutions Platform”. This includes custom-developed source code, user interface designs, business logic, and other technical assets created by our internal development team. The project was built for commercial use and has never been released publicly, shared, or licensed under any open-source or public domain terms. The leaked content replicates substantial portions of our private codebase, including file structure, logic, and naming conventions, without our permission. This constitutes a clear infringement of our company’s intellectual property rights.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

The original work is not available online. It resides in our company’s private development environment and has never been publicly shared or published on any platform.

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Our company uses several technological measures to protect and control access to our copyrighted materials:

Private [private] Repositories: The source code is stored in private repositories on platforms such as [private] and [private], accessible only to authorized developers with specific permissions.

User Authentication & Access Control: Access to the codebase is protected using multi-factor authentication (MFA) and role-based access controls (RBAC), ensuring only approved team members can view or modify the code.

Secure Local Development Environments: Our developers work within secured environments with encrypted drives, firewall protections, and endpoint security software.

Audit Logs & Monitoring: We maintain access logs and conduct regular audits to track and monitor any activity involving our proprietary source code.

These combined measures ensure that our code is not publicly accessible or shareable, and any breach or unauthorized distribution constitutes a direct violation of our security policies and copyright protections.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused repositories were created by someone who had unauthorized access to our private source code or obtained it through unlawful means such as leaks, internal breach, or improper file sharing. By uploading our proprietary code to a public GitHub repository, they bypassed the technological protections we had in place—such as private [private] repositories, access controls, and authentication mechanisms. This act exposed our confidential and copyrighted material to the public without our consent, effectively circumventing the systems we use to prevent unauthorized access and distribution.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
