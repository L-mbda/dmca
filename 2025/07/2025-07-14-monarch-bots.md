**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

[private] the [private] [private] and copyright holder of the project. All code was written by [private] and [private] not acting on behalf of any third party. The copyright belongs directly to [private].

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The project created by [private] and hosted at https://github.com/ertucuk/monarch-bots contains original source codes whose copyright belongs to [private].  
These codes were written by [private] on June 28, 2025 and violated the copyright of the GPL 3.0 License even though [private] name was written in it.  
The repository that is currently infringing on copyright is using this original code by copying it without permission.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

https://github.com/marcell91/ertucuk-bot

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/marcell91/ertucuk-bot

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

GPL 3 LICENSE

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

[private] project has a gpl 3.0 license. Therefore, [private] work cannot be used without permission. The copyright belongs to [private] and it is illegal to share or copy without permission.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Based on the representative number of forks I have reviewed, I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository.**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

gnu-affero-general-public-license-v3.0

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

[private] project is shared under GPL 3.0.

However, the other party:  
– Did not even remove [private] name  
– Necessary attribution ([private] name, project link, etc.) was not made  
– Shared [private] project without [private] permission, writing Ertucuk everywhere.

This violates the terms of the license.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

I believe that the project has been copied without permission. Since [private] did not share it with any license, giving attribution or adding a license does not legitimize this violation.

Therefore, there is no suitable solution other than removing the project.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

no I'm not.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
