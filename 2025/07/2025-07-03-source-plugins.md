GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

[private] the exclusive copyright holder of the “SkinBox.cs” plugin (a paid plugin for the video game Rust) and its required runtime dependencies "ChaosExtensionDownloader.cs" and “Oxide.Ext.Chaos.dll”.  
[private] own all rights under copyright, including the exclusive rights to reproduce, distribute, and publicly display the software. I am authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner ([private]/chaoscode.io) in enforcing those rights.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

SkinBox.cs - A commercially-licensed plugin that allows users to manage custom “skins” in the video game Rust. It is sold as its raw C# source code

Oxide.Ext.Chaos.dll - A proprietary runtime library that SkinBox depends on for core functionality.

ChaosExtensionDownloader.cs - Another commercially-licensed plugin that makes it easier for users to download install the managed Oxide.Ext.Chaos.dll to their server

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

SkinBox.cs: https://chaoscode.io/resources/skinbox.17/  
Oxide.Ext.Chaos.dll: https://chaoscode.io/resources/chaos.321/

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/ShoutoEzz/SkinBoxRust2025

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The only access control in place is that downloads of both SkinBox and Chaos from our website (chaoscode.io) are restricted to users who have purchased a valid product license. There are no additional DRM or encryption measures beyond this license‐gated download restriction.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

By bundling and publishing the compiled SkinBox binaries and the Chaos dependency directly in the repository, the project completely sidesteps our only gate-keeping measure — the license-controlled download on chaoscode.io. In other words:

Direct access to paid files: Instead of requiring users to purchase a license and download through our protected portal, anyone can git clone or download the repo ZIP and get the full packages.

No license validation required: Because the binaries and assets are simply included as public files, there’s no need to present or verify a license key at download time.

This design fully circumvents our license-gated download restriction by making the software freely accessible without any purchase or authorization.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Other Change

**Describe the change.**

Full removal or disabling of the infringing content from the repository (and any of its forks or clones).

Specifically, remove all files and directories containing SkinBox and Chaos binaries, source, and assets.

If possible, disable or archive the entire repository to prevent further unauthorized redistribution.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
