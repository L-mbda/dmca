**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

[private] the [private] [private] and [private] copyright holder of the code in question. [private] created this script [private] and did not license it under any open-source or public license. No one else has permission to copy, modify, or distribute [private] work, and the code was used on GitHub without [private] authorization.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original work is a custom-designed HTML and UI layout [private] created for a FiveM multicharacter script. While the base functionality of the script is derived from the open-source '[private]' script released by the [private] team, [private] developed a unique front-end interface from scratch. This includes the HTML structure, class layout, and visual arrangement which were not part of the original [private] release.

The infringing party published a modified version of '[private]' on GitHub, incorporating [private] original HTML interface without [private] permission. Additionally, I found traces of unique configuration entries [private] originally wrote in [private] [private] version's `config.lua`, which strongly suggests unauthorized use of [private] work. Although the repository was later [private], I am submitting this notice to document the infringement and request appropriate action be taken.

As evidence, [private] the original development archive (.rar file) of the script with a last modified date of February 21, 2024 — months before the infringing repository was published. The archive contains the original unmodified files showing [private] authorship. I am able to provide this file upon request.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

No, the original work was not published online. It was developed privately and only shared with selected servers or clients via direct delivery.

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

Specific files within the repository are infringing

**Identify only the specific file URLs within the repository that is infringing:**
