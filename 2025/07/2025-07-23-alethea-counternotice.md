I. Required Statement  
I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter Notice.

II. Identification of Content and Location  
The content that was disabled and the location where it appeared:

Repository URL: https://github.com/zenkodr/alethea-ai-backend  
Description: Backend code repository that was originally forked/cloned from a publicly available repository

III. Contact Information  
Name: [private]  
Email Address: [private]  
Telephone Number: [private]  
Physical Address: [private]  

IV. Good Faith Belief Statement  
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.

Basis for Good Faith Belief:

Lawful Fork/Clone of Public Repository: The repository in question was created as a legitimate fork or clone of a publicly available repository. According to GitHub's documentation on permissions and visibility of forks, "You can fork any public repository to your personal account" and "All forks of public repositories are public." If the original repository was publicly accessible at the time of forking, this action was entirely within GitHub's terms of service and applicable law.

Public Repository Rights: GitHub's own documentation states that when you fork a public repository, you have the right to do so under GitHub's platform rules. The forking mechanism is a fundamental feature of GitHub specifically designed to allow users to create copies of public repositories for development, contribution, and learning purposes.

Misidentification of Ownership Claims: The complainant's assertion that the repository contains "proprietary software code" exclusively owned by Alethea AI appears to be mistaken if the original repository was publicly accessible. Public repositories, by their very nature, are made available for forking under GitHub's terms of service.

Legitimate Use Under Platform Terms: The creation and maintenance of forks is explicitly permitted and encouraged by GitHub as part of open-source collaboration. The repository in question follows standard GitHub practices for forked repositories.

Lack of Proper DMCA Basis: The complainant has not demonstrated that the repository was created through unauthorized copying of private, proprietary code.   Instead, the evidence suggests this was a lawful fork of publicly available code, which is a permitted use under GitHub's platform rules.  
Good Faith Repository Management: The repository was created and maintained in good faith, following standard GitHub practices for forked repositories, with no intent to infringe on any legitimate copyright claims.

V. Jurisdiction and Service Consent  
I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.

VI. Signature  
I declare under penalty of perjury that the above information is accurate and that I am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the exclusive rights that are allegedly infringed.

Supporting Information

GitHub's Forking Policy  
According to GitHub's official documentation on "About permissions and visibility of forks":

"You can fork any public repository to your personal account"  
"All forks of public repositories are public"  
"A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the upstream repository"  
Public forks are explicitly permitted and do not inherit the permissions structure of the upstream repository in a way that would create copyright infringement

Legal Basis  
This counter notice is submitted in good faith based on:

The lawful nature of forking public repositories on GitHub  
The apparent misidentification of the repository as infringing when it was created through GitHub's standard forking mechanism  
The lack of evidence that the original repository was private or proprietary at the time of forking  
GitHub's own terms of service that permit and encourage forking of public repositories
