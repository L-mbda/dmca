I am a [private] at Google and am authorized to submit takedown notices on behalf of Google

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

Not applicable. This is a circumvention claim. Please see relevant sections below.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/TechnoIndian/RKPairip

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Google Play creates and makes available to software developers who distribute software through the Play Store proprietary “automatic protection,” a protected license verification process that app and game developers use to protect their copyrighted software against unauthorized modification and redistribution. The verification check is protected by a non-public technological measure to prevent it from being removed by attackers. More information about automatic integrity protection can be found here: https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity#automatic-protection.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The linked repository contains analysis and information about circumvention of automatic protection.   (https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity#automatic-protection). The project provides the required tooling (actual code in the repo that can circumvent the protection technology) and step-by-step technical instructions that can be followed to circumvent the protection technology.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

https://github.com/dev0id1/RKPairip  
https://github.com/Cyb3r9/RKPairip  
https://github.com/GCghosting/RKPairip  
https://github.com/Phuong39/RKPairip  
https://github.com/qw9901/RKPairip

**Based on the representative number of forks I have reviewed, I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository.**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
