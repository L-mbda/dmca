**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

[private] original project, published under the MIT License at https://github.com/ms0g/virtnd, was copied and redistributed in https://github.com/ceyert/l3netdev under the GPLv3 license. However, the user failed to comply with the terms of the MIT License, which requires that the original copyright notice and license text be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software. In their repository, the MIT license notice has been removed and replaced solely with a GPLv3 license. This violates the MIT License's condition of preserving attribution and the license text.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

To bring the project into compliance with the MIT License, the user must:  
Restore the original MIT License text in the repository, either in the root directory or in all relevant source files.  
Include proper attribution to [private] as the original author, clearly stating that portions of the code are derived from [private] project at https://github.com/ms0g/virtnd.  
If continuing to license the project under GPLv3, they must indicate which parts are under MIT and which (if any) are new contributions under GPLv3, in a way that does not misrepresent the licensing or authorship.
