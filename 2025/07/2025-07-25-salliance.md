I am the [private] and [private] of SAlliance, the company that owns all intellectual property related to the SAlliance App 2025 project. This proprietary software and all associated source code, design elements, and architecture were developed by interns and team members working under legally binding Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) that explicitly prohibit retaining, copying, or sharing any portion of the project ‚Äî including ideas, designs, or code ‚Äî during or after the [private].

The infringing party ([private]) was an [private] whose account was suspended due to misconduct. We gave him the opportunity to correct his behavior and continue, but he chose to resign instead. Despite all legal agreements, he has since published SAlliance's proprietary code publicly on GitHub without authorization.

As the copyright owner and [private] [private], I have full authority to act on behalf of SAlliance in this matter and to submit this DMCA takedown notice to protect our intellectual property.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The copyrighted work is a proprietary internal software project titled ‚Äú[private]‚Äù, owned and developed by SAlliance. It is a private, non-open-source application designed to enable secure, intelligent business communication between professionals via a chat-based interface. It includes:

1. A custom-built frontend using React.js and Tailwind CSS  
2. A Node.js and Express backend, integrated with socket-based real-time messaging features  
3. Custom-built user authentication and access control
4. Proprietary design system and UI components  
5. A specific folder and file structure, architecture patterns, and routing logic unique to our internal development standards

This codebase was developed entirely in-house by SAlliance team members and interns working under legally binding Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) that explicitly prohibit the retention, sharing, or repurposing of any part of the code, design, or architecture. The code has never been published, licensed, or distributed to any external parties, and access has always been strictly controlled via [private] repository permissions.

The project is hosted privately in our [private] organization at the following URL (not accessible to the public):

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

SAlliance takes active and intentional steps to restrict and protect access to its copyrighted materials, including the [private] codebase. The following technological and administrative measures are in place:

1. [private] [private] [private]    
a) All proprietary code is hosted in [private] [private] [private] under our [private] [private]: [private]  
b) Access is limited strictly to approved developers, interns, or contractors, each of whom must be manually granted permission.  
c) We regularly audit and revoke access when roles change or contracts terminate.

2. Role-Based Access Controls  
a) Permissions are granted based on roles (e.g., [private]) using [private]‚Äôs built-in organization team structure.  
b) Interns are given read-only access and only to specific branches or submodules when necessary.  
c) Admins are notified of all permission changes and access logs.

3. Legally Binding NDAs and Access Agreements  
a) All interns and contributors must sign an NDA and access agreement stating: They may not retain, share, or replicate any part of the codebase.  
b) All access is revoked at the end of their engagement.  
c) These agreements include explicit IP ownership, confidentiality, and return-of-materials clauses.

4. Device and Network Security  
a) Interns and contractors are required to use secure devices, and access is monitored via [private] logs.

5. Source Code Monitoring & Audit  
a) Periodic audits and monitoring of codebase history ensure no unauthorized copies, exports, or pull requests occur.  
b) Upon termination or resignation, all access is immediately revoked and account logs reviewed.

6. Effectiveness  
These controls are effective at:  
a) Preventing unauthorized access to private code  
b) Ensuring traceability of every user who touches our repositories  
c) Enforcing accountability through binding legal contracts  
d) Rapidly responding to access violations (as occurred in this case)

Despite these protections, the infringing party intentionally bypassed their legal obligations and exported code prior to access revocation. Their actions were deliberate and in breach of company policy, contractual obligations, and copyright law.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The infringing repository at https://github.com/Korbin-Hillan/LinkedIn-Chat-Application was created by unlawfully reproducing and republishing code that was developed under a legally binding internship agreement with SAlliance.

1. Access Granted Solely for Internal Development Under NDA  
The individual was an [private] at SAlliance and had direct access to contribute to internal repositories as part of assigned project work. This access was:  
a) Granted only after signing a formal NDA and [private] agreement  
b) Limited to tasks within the scope of the internship  
c) Understood to be temporary, controlled, and for company use only

They had access not just to read but to create and commit code ‚Äî but all such work was clearly defined as the sole intellectual property of SAlliance, with no right to retain or redistribute it outside the organization.

2. Unauthorized Retention and Reuse of Company Code  
After their [private] was suspended due to misconduct, the individual:  
a) Resigned rather than correct their behavior  
b) Retained local copies of SAlliance‚Äôs proprietary code created during their internship  
c) Later uploaded this proprietary material to a public GitHub repository under their [private] account, in breach of the NDA and copyright law

This bypassed our organization‚Äôs private [private] access controls by moving the code from our controlled environment into the public domain ‚Äî an act of willful circumvention.

3. Disguising Origin and Misrepresentation  
The individual renamed the project ‚ÄúLinkedIn-Chat-Application‚Äù, concealing its association with SAlliance and creating the false appearance of originality. This deception:  
a) Defeated attribution and origin detection  
b) Could mislead others into believing the code was their own or open source  
c) Undermined both technological and legal protections we had in place

Summary  
While the individual had authorized access during their [private], it was:  
a) Strictly governed by NDA  
b) Limited to work-for-hire conditions  
c) Never granted for personal use, retention, or public redistribution

By retaining and reposting code after resignation, the individual intentionally circumvented both legal agreements and organizational controls, violating copyright law, GitHub‚Äôs terms of service, and 17 U.S. Code ¬ß 1201 (anti-circumvention provisions).

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Based on the representative number of forks I have reviewed, I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository.**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer‚Äôs contact information? If so, please provide it.**
