While GitHub did not find sufficient information to determine a valid anti-circumvention claim, we determined that this takedown notice contains other valid copyright claim(s).

Note: Because the reported network that contained the allegedly infringing content was larger than one hundred (100) repositories, and the submitter alleged that all or most of the forks were infringing to the same extent as the parent repository, GitHub processed the takedown notice against the entire network of 102 repositories, inclusive of the parent repository.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

[private] the [private] and [private] of the proprietary software “Raven B4” and its predecessor “Raven B3.” I am submitting this takedown on behalf of [private] organization, which distributes Raven B4 commercially. While Raven B3 was released for free in binary form on [private] official [private] [private], its source code was never made public or licensed for deobfuscation, modification, or redistribution. Any reposting or forking of decompiled or modified versions of Raven B3's source code on GitHub is unauthorized and infringes on my copyright.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

Raven B4 and Raven B3 are original Minecraft modifications developed and owned by [private] organization. Raven B4 is a paid, closed-source product actively maintained and distributed through our [private] [private] server to verified customers. It enhances Minecraft gameplay with advanced features such as automation, combat modules, and visual enhancements. It is promoted on our official [private] [private] at [private], as well as on [private], which links directly to our sales [private] at [private].

Raven B3 is the direct predecessor to Raven B4. It was publicly released for free in binary form via a .jar file on [private], but at no point was the source code released or licensed for decompilation, modification, or redistribution. The software was obfuscated, and its release did not grant permission to reverse engineer or rehost the source code in any form, as explicitly stated in the video description of [private]: "disclaimer: raven b3 is free to use, but the code is proprietary. you are not permitted to decompile, deobfuscate, modify, or redistribute the software or its source code in any form."

The following repositories are infringing:

https://github.com/landon-dev/Raven-b3  
The README openly states, “Raven B3 deobfuscated,” along with “5 hours of remapping, 15min of bugfixing.” This repository was created by reverse engineering and modifying Raven B3's compiled code. It has been forked numerous times by other users. Based on the representative number of forks I have reviewed, I believe that all forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository and should also be disabled: https://github.com/landon-dev/Raven-b3/network/members (101 forks)

https://github.com/Kopamed/Raven-bPLUS  
This repository is based directly on decompiled Raven B3 source code. The README says, “Raven b+ is built on top of Raven b3.” The first commit (https://github.com/Kopamed/Raven-bPLUS/commit/ffa0c69a85d7dbf317dff91579d39b810d244e80) was made by GitHub user [private] and matches the same raw decompiled code as https://github.com/landon-dev/Raven-b3. Despite being under a different repo, the codebase originates from the same unauthorized source. Based on the representative number of forks I have reviewed, I believe that all forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository and should also be disabled: https://github.com/kopamed/Raven-bPLUS/network/members (121 forks)

https://github.com/TuiLaZeroTwo/RavenB4Revamp  
This repository contains a deobfuscated version of Raven B4. The README explicitly credits “[private] for the original leak, crack, and remap” - referring to the cracked and decompiled leak of Raven B4 posted at [private] (site is now offline). It has one fork, which should also be removed:  https://github.com/BLUUSHY/RavenB4Revamp

https://github.com/Sink1337/raven-bs-alpha  
https://github.com/Zambosss/raven-bs-alpha  
https://github.com/M4rkoG/raven-bs-alpha  
These are all reuploads or clones of [invalid], which GitHub already removed in the previous takedown ([private])

https://github.com/Nicos0120/Raven-bS-Plus2  
This repository is a reupload of [invalid], which was removed in the prior DMCA. It appears to contain a slightly older version of "Raven bS".

Neither Raven B4 nor Raven B3 has ever been released under an open-source license, and no permission has been granted to share, fork, decompile, modify, or host their source code. All of the repositories listed above are unauthorized derivatives and constitute copyright infringement.

I have also edited the video description of [private] (the Raven B3 release video) to include the words “dmca june 11” as proof of copyright ownership of both Raven B3 and Raven B4.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

For Raven B4, we use a Hardware ID (HWID)-based authentication system to control access to our software. When a user purchases the client, their unique HWID is whitelisted and stored in our secure database. Our custom loader verifies the user's HWID during login, and only if the HWID is authorized the client is loaded from our server. Our API servers, which handle authentication and validation, are hosted at [private] for this purpose. In addition, the software is protected using code obfuscation to prevent reverse engineering and tampering.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

These repositories inherit the same unauthorized, deobfuscated code from the previously removed “Raven bS” project and continue to bypass our protection mechanisms, including HWID authentication.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

https://github.com/BLUUSHY/RavenB4Revamp

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**
