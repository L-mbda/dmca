This code is not open source, has never been publicly released or licensed for redistribution, and is protected as original intellectual property under applicable copyright laws.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

-Access to our proprietary source code is controlled through multiple technological measures, including:  
-Use of private, access-restricted repositories (e.g., private GitHub repositories)  
-Mandatory authentication with unique user credentials  
-Role-based permission controls limiting access to authorized personnel only   
-Infrastructure-level restrictions, including IP-based access controls and VPN requirements in some cases  
-Vanta Partnership

These measures effectively prevent unauthorized individuals from viewing, copying, or distributing the copyrighted source code. The only way this material became publicly accessible was through unauthorized access and subsequent redistribution, which violates these protections.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project circumvents our technological protection measures by publicly distributing our proprietary source code without authorization. This code was originally secured within [private], access-controlled [private] restricted to authorized personnel only. The unauthorized party bypassed these access controls by obtaining the code without permission and uploading it to a public GitHub repository, making it accessible to anyone. This circumvention undermines the technological barriers we have in place to protect our copyrighted material.
