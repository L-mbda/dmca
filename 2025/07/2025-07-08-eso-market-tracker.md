Dear GitHub Support,

I am the [private] and copyright holder of the software titled ESO Market Tracker, originally
published to https://esomarkettracker.com on July 17, 2023.

It has come to my attention that the following repositories hosted on GitHub contain substantial
portions of [private] copyrighted work without authorization:

1. https://github.com/TamrielSavingsCo/itemnames

Specifically:

● itemNames.JSON  
● itemNames.js

These files appear to be a direct export from [private] service, which can be queried using the
following GraphQL call (example cURL request included for demonstration):

2. [invalid]

This repository:

● Uses proprietary data originated from [private] service without permission.  
● Copies core logic, formatting, and design patterns that were developed originally for
ESO Market Tracker.  
● Includes, in its commit history, a file named TSCPriceNameData.lua (see this commit)
which is a direct representation of proprietary data sourced from my project.

These duplications were made without [private] consent and constitute a clear infringement of [private]
intellectual property rights.
