Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

https://github.com/phpwdk/adapay_sdk

**Based on the representative number of forks I have reviewed, I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository.**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

mit-license

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The infringer has violated the terms of [private] original license in several critical ways:

1. **Failure to Provide Attribution:** The infringer has failed to include [private] original copyright notice and the license text with their copy of the software. [private] original license requires that this information be preserved.

2. **Wrongful Removal and Replacement of License:** More significantly, they have completely removed [private] original LICENSE file and have replaced it with their own. This action deliberately misrepresents the authorship and ownership of the code.

By removing [private] copyright notice and replacing the license, the infringer is attempting to claim [private] original work as their own, which is a direct and severe violation of the license terms under which [private] made the code available.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

Given the deliberate nature of the violation, where [private] original LICENSE file was wrongfully removed and replaced, the most appropriate and direct path to compliance is the complete and immediate removal of the entire infringing repository.

Alternatively, to bring the project into compliance, the infringer must, at a minimum, perform the following actions:  
1. Completely delete their illegitimate LICENSE file.  
2. Restore [private] original LICENSE file, identical to the one in [private] repository (https://github.com/cccdl/adapay_sdk).  
3. Add a clear and prominent attribution statement in the project's README.md file, crediting [private] (cccdl) as the original author and providing a direct link back to [private] original repository.

**Do you have the alleged infringerâ€™s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
