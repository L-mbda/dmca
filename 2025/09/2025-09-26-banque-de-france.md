Hi


My name is [private] and I am an authorized representative of Banque de France. I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

It has come to our attention that a WEB page illegally containing Banque de France code is available and associated with the url https://github.com/Dmtry32/AccreditationApp.


The mention at the bottom of the page associated with the url above explicitly states that the content belongs to Banque de France (© 2024 - Application d'Accréditation Banque de France. Tous droits réservés.).


I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.


Please contact me if you require any further information.


Regards,
