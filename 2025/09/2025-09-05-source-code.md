Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] of the code and the [private] of the repo, the code is written by [private] in it's entirety.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

[private] repository contains code that is licensed solely for use in the application Sora. To prevent unauthorized use, the code was encrypted. Recently, however, the decryption key was leaked, and a fork of [private] repository was created. In this fork, the code was decrypted using GitHub Actions and then redistributed.

These decrypted files are now being shared and used in other applications, which directly violates [private] license terms that explicitly restrict use of the code to Sora only. This fork circumvents [private] encryption protections and enables unauthorized use, constituting a clear infringement of [private] rights.

For this reason, I am submitting this DMCA takedown request to have the infringing fork removed.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

https://github.com/50n50/sources

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/tamocruz/sources

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

[private] have implemented encryption on all source code files so that they cannot be read, modified, or used without the correct decryption key. This encryption effectively restricts access, ensuring the code can only be used within the authorized application Sora. Without the key, the files remain unusable and inaccessible, thereby controlling access to the copyrighted material.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project bypasses [private] encryption by using a leaked decryption key within GitHub Actions to automatically decrypt all protected files. This process removes the encryption safeguard I put in place, making the source code fully accessible and usable outside of the authorized application Sora, thereby directly circumventing [private] technological protection measures.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

https://github.com/tamocruz/sources

**Based on the representative number of forks I have reviewed, I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository.**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringerâ€™s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

I do not have this no.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
