Note: Because the reported network that contained the allegedly infringing content was larger than one hundred (100) repositories, and the submitter alleged that all or most of the forks were infringing to the same extent as the parent repository, GitHub processed the takedown notice against the entire network of 158 repositories, inclusive of the parent repository.

DMCA Copyright Removal Request on Behalf of Multichoice Africa Ltd. (“Multichoice”)

We are writing to you from Irdeto B.V. ("Irdeto"). Amongst other clients we currently represent Multichoice Africa Ltd. (“Multichoice”) with regards to the protection of their intellectual property rights on the internet.  

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I have taken fair use into consideration.

It has come to our client’s attention that there is currently content on GitHub, which infringes their intellectual property rights. 

Copyrighted work:

MultiChoice controls the exclusive rights to display, transmit and reproduce all MultiChoice transmissions and content including, but not limited to, the transmissions of all DSTV, Showmax, SuperSport, and M-Net television channels, tv shows and movies via all mediums including, but not limited to, transmission over IP. Rebroadcasting, retransmitting, or replicating MultiChoice’s content without their authorization, is a breach of their rights and is unlawful.  Please find a document with the infringement highlighted attached to this email.

Specifically, copyrighted work being infringed is listed below: 

  https://www.dstv.com/m-net/en-za/show/reyka   
Infringing content:

The repository in question contains source code for an illicit application titled Streamflix (also referred to as Sflix), which facilitates unauthorized access to MultiChoice’s copyrighted content, as well as numerous other copyrighted works.

The repository’s README file provides a direct link for downloading the infringing application. Additionally, the README promotes the application by highlighting features such as being “100% free and without advertisements,” and offering “an extensive collection of movies and TV shows” available with “no account or registration required.” Irdeto have tested the infringing application and verified the availability of Multichoice content. We can provide the evidence upon request.

We refer to the following URLs on which the infringing material subject to this copyright complaint is located: 

https://github.com/stantanasi/streamflix  
Additionally, a significant portion of the network of forked repositories (larger that 100 repositories) has been reviewed.  Based on the representative number of forks I have reviewed; I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository.  
The forks we are referring to can be found through the following URL: https://github.com/stantanasi/streamflix/network/members

We respectfully request that you forward this complaint to the user responsible for the repository, with the request that they remove the infringing content expeditiously and respond to Irdeto to confirm that the content has been removed.

Formal declaration: 

 

I, [private], as a representative of Irdeto, digitally sign this letter and confirm that I have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law. 

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that Multichoice has authorized Irdeto to act as its non-exclusive agent for copyright infringement notification.  

Nothing in this letter is intended or shall be construed to constitute an express or implied waiver of any of Multichoice’s rights or remedies, including any rights or remedies in respect to infringements not explicitly stated, whether current or in the future, all of which are expressly reserved. 


Yours faithfully,
