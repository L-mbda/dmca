1) Identification of the copyrighted work  
NautilusTrader (copyrighted code, documentation, and associated files), published at:  
https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader  
  
2) Identification of infringing material hosted on GitHub  
Primary repository: https://github.com/poseisysstems/posei_trader  
  
The posei_trader​ repository and related GitHub pages reproduce NautilusTrader’s expressive content (code and documentation) with only superficial changes. Representative examples include the repository’s README.md, that substantially reproduces our text - including our “© 2015–2025 Nautech Systems Pty Ltd” copyright notice, evidencing extensive copying. Also multiple source/doc files whose structure and language mirror NautilusTrader. We can supply line-level diffs upon request.  
3) Basis for removal — copyright infringement  
The accused repositories host verbatim and substantially similar copyrighted material derived from NautilusTrader without authorization. While our project is available under LGPL-3.0, that license is conditional; where conditions aren’t met (see §4/§5 obligations via GPLv3), copying is not authorized and therefore infringing. In particular, the accused repositories do not preserve original notices and do not give prominent notice of modifications and their dates, both of which are required when conveying modified source versions.  
  
GPLv3 §5 (incorporated by LGPL-3.0) requires that a modified work “carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date,” among other notice-preservation duties.  
  
Representative example of file-level notice removal: commit 877fa75 removes the NautilusTrader/Nautech Systems copyright and LGPL-3.0 header from crates/cli/src/opt.rs (16-line header deleted): https://github.com/poseisysstems/posei_trader/commit/877fa756eb81205abb8af70c299262a3d0af6cf9.  
Given the breadth of copying and omission/removal of notices, our position is that full removal from GitHub is the appropriate remedy.  
  
4) Remedy  
GitHub asks complainants to explain what the user would need to do to remedy the infringement. Our view is that the only sufficient remedy is removal of the identified repositories and any forks containing the same infringing material. If GitHub elects to allow corrective steps instead of removal, then at a minimum the user would need to:  
  
Restore/preserve all original copyright and license notices in every copied file.  
  
Add prominent attribution in the README (top) that this is a modified version of NautilusTrader by Nautech Systems Pty Ltd with a link to our repo.  
  
Provide prominent modification notices listing material changes and dates (e.g., CHANGES.md).  
  
Keep an unaltered copy of LGPL-3.0 at the repo root and ensure any distributed binaries reference the source and license.  
  
These items reflect the notice-preservation and “state changes” obligations under LGPL-3.0/GPLv3 and satisfy your “explain the remedy” requirement. (Nevertheless, due to scope and bad-faith context, we maintain that removal is appropriate.)  
  
5) Forks  
Please disable any forks containing the same infringing material. Your policy describes how forks may be handled and allows representative treatment where networks are large.  
  
6) Context  
The operator is simultaneously running a cloned marketing site that lists [private] personally ("[private]") on a “team” page ([private]). This underscores bad faith, and is likely to mislead users as to affiliation. We include this solely as context to underscore urgency; we are not asking GitHub to act on off-GitHub content via this notice, and this context explains why removal is preferred over remediation.  
7) Good-faith statement  
I have a good-faith belief that the use of the copyrighted materials described above is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.  
  
8) Accuracy and authority statement  
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
