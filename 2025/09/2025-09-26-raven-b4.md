Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and copyright owner of “Raven B4” and “Raven B3”, proprietary Minecraft clients. Raven B4 is a paid product. Raven B3 was released only as an obfuscated binary file with a strict no-decompilation clause. No source code for either client has ever been released or licensed.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

Raven B4 is a paid, closed-source Minecraft client developed and sold by my organization. It includes proprietary features and is protected by HWID authentication and code obfuscation.

Raven B3 was the free predecessor, released only as an obfuscated .jar file, no source code was ever published or licensed. The release explicitly prohibited decompilation or redistribution, as stated in the video description: [private]  

The following repositories are infringing:

https://github.com/itmejd/raven-bs-v2  
This is a reupload of a previously disabled repository: [private]  
The original infringing repository was removed under the following takedown: [private]  
The commit history shows the GitHub user “itsmejd” was a key contributor to the original [private] repository. As seen in this image: [private], commits from the user were sent to a webhook channel tied to the [private] repository. A few months after the DMCA takedown, a new commit from the same user appears in the newly created raven-bs-v2 repository with the same infringing codebase. This pattern suggests a deliberate effort to circumvent the original takedown by presenting the same material as a "new" standalone project. This has been forked 10 times, all infringing to the same degree as the parent repository: https://github.com/itmejd/raven-bs-v2/network/members

https://github.com/SASILOXR/Raven-Bs-MW-Edition  
https://github.com/HPTrongMC/Raven-bS  
These are forks of a previously disabled repository: [private]  
The original infringing repository was removed under the following takedown: [private]  
The repository's README openly admits to infringement by stating: "[private]"  
The first repository has been forked twice, both infringing to the same degree: https://github.com/SASILOXR/Raven-Bs-MW-Edition/network/members

https://github.com/ImLegiitXD/Raven-bPLUS-main  
This is a reupload of a previously disabled repository: [private]  
The original infringing repository was removed under the following takedown: [private]  
The repository description contains an explicit admission of intent by stating "[private]" in reference to the earlier DMCA takedowns.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

For Raven B4, we use a Hardware ID (HWID)-based authentication system to control access to our software. When a user purchases the client, their unique HWID is whitelisted and stored in our secure database. Our custom loader verifies the user's HWID during login, and only if the HWID is authorized the client is loaded from our server. Our API servers, which handle authentication and validation, are hosted at [private] for this purpose. In addition, the software is protected using code obfuscation to prevent reverse engineering and tampering.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

These repositories inherit the same unauthorized, deobfuscated code from the previously removed "Raven bS" and "Raven bPlus" projects and continue to bypass our protection mechanisms, including HWID authentication.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**
