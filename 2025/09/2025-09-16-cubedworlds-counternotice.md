Hello, im a [private] hired by the [private] of this content in order to answer the DMCA TAKEDOWN, you can find the autorization signed by [private] attached to this counter notice.

The takedown request is unfounded and must be rejected. My client is the [private] [private] and copyright holder of the preexisting code integrated into the delivered software. Under 17 U.S.C. § 101 and § 103(b), preexisting materials incorporated into a derivative work remain the exclusive property of their original [private], and protection of the derivative work does not extend to such preexisting components. The inclusion of this module was not commissioned by the claimant and, critically, there was no written contract that could qualify the development as a “work made for hire” under 17 U.S.C. § 101(2). Furthermore, the entity filing the takedown is neither registered nor legally recognized, and has submitted the notice anonymously with the evident purpose of harming my client’s business.

Additionally, the “mod” cited in the takedown bears no relation to the commissioned work delivered via [private]; the only similarity lies in my client’s individual programming style. The version published is an independent and distinct work, substantially improving upon and diverging from any earlier versions that may have served as a technical foundation. It incorporates new features, different functionalities, and a separate creative expression, making it a separate copyrightable work under 17 U.S.C. § 102(a). Accordingly, pursuant to the DMCA (17 U.S.C. § 512(g)), my client disputes the claim and asserts that the complainant lacks standing to enforce copyright over code it neither authored nor owns.

Moreover, even assuming that any portion of prior material were implicated, my client’s use is highly transformative, creating a distinct work with new features and functionalities that go well beyond any prior version. Under 17 U.S.C. § 107, such transformative use weighs heavily in favor of fair use, particularly as the disputed work does not supplant the market for any alleged prior version.

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

Furthermore, it is evident that the takedown request was not filed to protect any legitimate copyright interest, but rather as an act of retaliation. The claimant engaged in a pattern of abusive behavior towards my client, including repeatedly altering the scope of work, demanding additional features beyond the agreed commission, and subjecting my client to insults and mistreatment throughout the project. Ultimately, the claimant failed to pay the remaining balance of €200 owed under the commission. The present DMCA takedown is therefore a bad-faith attempt to harm my client’s reputation and business, unrelated to any genuine copyright claim, and should be rejected pursuant to the DMCA’s requirement of good-faith assertions (17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3)(A)(v)).

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**
