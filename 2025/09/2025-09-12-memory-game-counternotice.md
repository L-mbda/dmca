Dear GitHub Trust & Safety Team,

Please consider this as my official and complete DMCA Counter Notice. This message replaces any prior submissions.

1. My Contact Information:  
Please note that the following is my original and correct address, which replaces any previous address submitted.  
· Full Name: [private]  
· Address: [private]  
· Phone Number: [private]  
· Email Address: [private]  

2. Identification of the Removed Material:  
The repository that was disabled is located at:  
https://github.com/Eithar-Wageh/Memory-Card-Game

3. Good Faith Belief & Consent to Jurisdiction:  
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.

I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.

4. Explanation of the Misidentification:  
· Educational Context: The project was a required task in an educational program where students were divided into teams. The complainant and [private] were on the same team. He created a repository for the team's initial work, to which [private] was added as a collaborator.  
· Unjustified Removal & Independent Development: [private] was later removed from that repository without justification. Since the project was a required part of the curriculum and [private] had already listed it on [private] CV, [private] created a new repository and wrote the entire code from scratch based on [private] own implementation.    
· Independent Work & Material Differences: [private] repository is not a fork or copy. It was built from scratch with independently written code and a different architectural logic. It includes unique features and game mechanics not present in the original collaborative project. Most importantly, all visual assets (images) were personally created by [private] on [private] own device, and [private] retain the original source files as proof of [private] ownership. Any sound effects used are properly sourced from open-source libraries, available for public use.  
· No Evidence Provided & Private Repository: The complainant has provided no concrete evidence (such as code comparisons) because no copying exists. Furthermore, the repository in question has always been [private], and [private] have had no access to it since [private] removal, making any claim of copying from its current state impossible.

[private] maintain comprehensive evidence of [private] independent development process and original asset creation, which [private] can provide upon request.

5. Electronic Signature:
