Dear GitHub Trust & Safety,  
  
We, MarkScan Digital IP Pvt. Ltd., have been duly authorized by Crunchyroll, LLC to enforce its copyright rights under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), 17 U.S.C. § 512, and related international laws.  
  
This notice concerns infringing manifests hosted on GitHub that enable the Sora application to stream Crunchyroll’s copyrighted works without authorization. These manifests function as configuration files that directly connect the Sora piracy client to unlicensed streaming sources. They are therefore integral to the infringement and fall within the scope of GitHub’s DMCA takedown policy.  
  
Although prior notices addressed the repositories [private] and [private], additional infringing manifests remain on GitHub under different repositories. These are identified in Appendix B.  
  
Why This Is Infringing  
  
The manifests listed in Appendix B are not neutral code. They are specifically written to direct the Sora application to piracy sources, where copyrighted anime works owned by Crunchyroll, LLC can be streamed illegally. By hosting and distributing these manifests, GitHub is facilitating access to infringing material.  
  
Ownership Statement  
  
Crunchyroll, LLC is the owner of certain rights to a vast catalog of copyright-protected works, hereafter referred to as “Protected Work(s).” A representative list of these Protected Work(s) has been included as Appendix A.  
  
Good Faith Statement  
  
We have a good faith belief that the use of the Protected Work(s) owned and/or controlled by our client in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owners, their agents, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.  
  
Request  
  
We hereby request that GitHub remove or disable access to the infringing manifests identified in Appendix B, in accordance with 17 U.S.C. § 512 and GitHub’s DMCA takedown policy.  
  
The information in this notice is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, we are authorized to act on behalf of Crunchyroll, LLC.  
  
Sincerely,  
[private]
