TO WHOMESOEVER IT MAY CONCERN

 

I am writing to notify you of a copyright infringement involving proprietary and confidential code that is the exclusive property of Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America (TIAA). I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. I am authorized by TIAA to act on its behalf in submitting and pursuing takedown notices of TIAA as well as all TIAA subsidiaries.

 

 

1. Identification of Copyrighted Work:

 

The copyrighted work at issue is proprietary source code developed and owned by TIAA, specifically including internal software scripts, secure authentication functions, and non-public TIAA URLs and endpoints. This material is proprietary, confidential, unpublished, and protected under copyright law. Unauthorized disclosure is strictly prohibited and constitutes an infringement of TIAA’s intellectual property rights and trade secrets.

 

2. Identification of Infringing Material:

 

The infringing material is located in the GitHub repository: https://github.com/availbcbsnc/nick-aci-work

 

Specifically, the file containing the unauthorized, verbatim and/or derivative copy of TIAA’s proprietary code is: https://github.com/availbcbsnc/nick-aci-work/blob/4aaac2a1a0305e20e8f036ba07acc736dc603819/get_token.py

 

To the best of my knowledge, the relevant infringing material is contained entirely within this file, though a more comprehensive review may reveal infringement across additional locations or forks.

 

3. Forks / Additional Infringing Material:

 

At this time, we direct this claim specifically at the file and repository identified above. Should further infringing forks or files be discovered, we reserve the right to supplement this notice.

 

4. Remedy to Cure Infringement:

 

The user must remove the entire file get_token.py and any other copies or derivatives of TIAA’s proprietary material from the repository and all forks, and must not publish or disclose such confidential TIAA source code or URLs in any public forum or repository without the explicit, written authorization of TIAA. There is no remedy possible other than removal, as these materials are not licensed for public use or distribution under any circumstance.

7. Good Faith Statement:

 

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

 

8. Accuracy & Authority Statement:

 

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
