**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

A copyright owner at Samsung, who also serves as a [private] for the WorldSkills Mobile Robotics Team ([private]), asked me to pursue removal of the infringing code after I discovered it was being published. While I am not an employee of Samsung, I am acting at his request.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The Robot_CPP folder contains Samsung’s code for controlling Studica Robotics’ robot. This code was created for internal use in WorldSkills [private] and was never intended for public release. Within this folder, files such as Mission.cpp and DepthCamera.cpp contain unique code not authored by us, but the vast majority of the remaining content is a direct, one-to-one copy of Samsung’s proprietary code.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

Unfortunately, I cannot provide the original source code directly, as it was never publicly published. However, it was made available through the following official channel, restricted to registered and authorized members only:  
https://cafe.naver.com/wsmobilerobotics
