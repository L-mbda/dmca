Dear Sir or Madam,  
  
We have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice and we have taken fair use into consideration. We are writing to you from Irdeto B.V. ("Irdeto"). Amongst other clients we currently represent MEASAT Broadcast Network Systems Sdn. Bhd. ("Astro") with regards to the protection of their intellectual property rights on the internet. It has come to Astro’s attention that there is currently content on Github.com, which infringes their rights.       
Infringed Copyrighted Works:  
  
Astro controls the exclusive rights to display, transmit and reproduce all Astro transmissions and content including, but not limited tom the transmission of all Astro and Sooka content via all mediums including, but not limited to, transmission over IP. Rebroadcasting, retransmitting or replicating Astro’s content without their authorization, is a breach of their rights and unlawful.  
    
Reference Websites:  
  
https://www.astro.com.my/  
  
https://sooka.my/  
   
  
Infringement Description:  
  
The infringing service engages in “CDN leeching,” circumventing security measures by bypassing authentication, encryption, and geo-restrictions to stream Astro’s content directly from Astro’s CDN without authorization. This violates 17 U.S.C. and DMCA § 1201.   
    
Infringing Material (please note the whole repository is dedicated to illicit IPTV services):
