Alright, here’s how I’d put it—straight up:

1. There’s no copied code here, period.  
They’re saying we somehow stuck [private] project code in our repo, but after digging through everything (even the dusty corners), I can honestly say: nothing from [private] or [private] shows up anywhere in our stuff. Not as source, not even as a stray compiled bit.

2. It’s literally just a binary.  
No source code hanging around in this repo, just the finished binary. And that binary? Built from scratch, by us, with zero pieces from the claimant’s codebase. No links, no hidden dependencies, nada.

3. Show receipts or it didn’t happen.  
If someone’s going to claim we copied their code, they gotta bring some real technical proof. I’m talking matching function names, file hashes, reverse-engineered code—anything solid. Otherwise, this complaint feels more like guesswork than fact.

4. We built this ourselves.  
The binary in question? 100% our own work. No proprietary code, no sneaky open-source snippets from [private] or any related module. Sure, maybe our app does some similar things, but that’s not the same as stealing code. Not even close.

5. The license thing is off.  
Seems like there’s been a mix-up over open source rules. Just because an app shows ads or has paid features doesn’t mean it’s breaking the license—especially if their code isn’t even in play. You only run into license issues if you’re using or sharing their actual code, which we’re not.

6. Happy to chat if there’s real proof.  
We’re all about following open source licenses and DMCA rules. If someone can actually show us concrete evidence of infringement, we’ll deal with it ASAP. But right now? Haven’t seen anything convincing—just a lot of speculation.

That’s the real story.
