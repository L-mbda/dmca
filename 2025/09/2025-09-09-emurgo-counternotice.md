**Are you the owner of the content that has been disabled, or authorized to act on the owner’s behalf?**

Yes, I am the content owner.

**Please describe the nature of your content ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

The original content and [private] derivative work are both licensed under MIT license. The original content is located in [private] and the MIT license was added on June 6th 2024 in /LICENSE.txt file. The /README.md file links to the license and starts with:

#  Dullahan

Dullahan is an [open source] (LICENSE.txt) SDK primarily developed for building wallets.

**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

It's verifiable that in the [private] repository:
- LICENSE.txt was in the root directory (which is standard)
- README.md states the project Dullahan is open source and links to the license
- The LICENSE.txt (and README.md linking to the license) was present since June 6th 2024 until at least 20th August 2025
- Both LICENSE.txt and README.md were present on dev and main branches
- There were main branch protections preventing unilateral addition of the license by [private] without code review and approval
- There has never been a different license while I had access to the repository

In addition, I claim that:
- Some of the code contributed by [private] was created before [private] was contracted by EMURGO
- A significant portion of the code contributed by [private] was not requested by EMURGO (and there was no task associated to the contributed code)
- I would have never contributed [private] own code (that EMURGO never asked for), unless I was confident I'm protected by the guarantees of the MIT license

I believe that EMURGO practiced rigorous code reviews and the senior management was aware of the presence of the LICENSE.txt and understands the consequences of MIT license.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**
