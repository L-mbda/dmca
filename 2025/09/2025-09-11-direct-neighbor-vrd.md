**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] [private] and copyright holder of the software in question, which [private] released under the MIT License. While the license permits reuse and modification, it requires that [private] copyright notice and the full license text be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software.

The repository in question includes the license text but fails to attribute authorship to [private], and presents the work in a way that omits [private] authorship and original repository. It was not forked from the original project, nor was any credit given outside of the copied license block. This creates a misleading impression of original authorship and violates the intent and terms of the MIT License. I have not authorized this kind of reuse, which lacks proper attribution.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original copyrighted work is a software repository titled “Direct-Neighbor-VRD”, which [private] developed and published as the official implementation of the research paper “[private].”

The project includes original Python code, scripts, and configurations for building graph-based datasets and training graph neural network models (specifically GCNs) for information extraction from visually rich documents (VRD). It supports multiple benchmark datasets (e.g., FUNSD, SROIE, CORD, XFUND, WildReceipt) and is structured with components such as builder.py, train.py, and supporting files like requirements.txt.

The code was written by [private] and released under the MIT License, with proper acknowledgment to paper co-authors and third-party libraries used. The repository is hosted publicly here:  
https://github.com/HamzaGbada/direct-neighbor-vrd

The infringing repository copies this codebase — including file names, logic, documentation, and structure — without appropriate attribution or visible credit to [private] as the original developer. Although the license file is present, the reuse fails to acknowledge [private] authorship or link back to the original repository, thereby violating the attribution requirement of the MIT License and misrepresenting the source of the work.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

Yes, the original work is publicly available online at [private] [private] GitHub repository:  
https://github.com/HamzaGbada/direct-neighbor-vrd

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/tayfunai/direct-neighbor-vrd-meta-learning

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

mit-license

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The MIT License requires that the copyright notice and the full license text be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software. Although the infringing repository includes the license text, it fails to properly attribute [private] as the original author of the code. Additionally, the infringing repository was not forked from the original project and does not provide any clear credit or link back to the original source. This omission of attribution and misrepresentation of authorship violates the terms and intent of the MIT License.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

To bring the project into compliance with the MIT License, the infringing repository should clearly attribute [private] as the original author by including [private] name and a link to the original repository in the README or project documentation. They should ensure the full MIT License text, including the original copyright notice, is present in all copies of the software.

Alternatively, the repository owner could fork the original project on GitHub, which would maintain proper attribution and history. If proper attribution is not possible or desired, removing or making the repository private would also resolve the infringement.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
