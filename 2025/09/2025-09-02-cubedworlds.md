**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

[private] own the copyrighted software commissioned by and developed for CubedWorlds / MRM Development Studios as private, proprietary code. The developer (GitHub user @muriplz, “[private]”) delivered the code and was paid in full for the relevant deliverables. Our commissions covered CWMod, CWProxy, and Timekeeper, including the economy/shop subsystem implemented inside CWMod. Ownership of delivered code was part of our commissioning terms and payments ([private] orders [private], [private], [private]). The code at issue is not open-source and was never authorized for public release or relicensing.

Note on licensing bad faith:  
The infringing repo attaches a “WTFPL (EXCEPT Cubed Worlds)” style license and previously attached MIT headers to CW-only deliverables. These unilateral, hostile or fabricated licenses do not cure copying; no open-source license was ever granted for CW-only code.
