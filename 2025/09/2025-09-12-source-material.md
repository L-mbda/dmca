I am writing on behalf of my institute, the University of New South Wales (UNSW), [private], [private], specifically my team running the course [private] [private] [private].

We have found several repositories on GitHub containing copyrighted materials from our course, in particular assignment specifications, lab specifications, project specifications (see below).

The materials are ours, not the repository owners’, and we have never given permission to post these anywhere. We suspect the owners of these repositories are former students of our course, who ignored our rights.

We kindly but urgently request that you take these materials down. We hope this matter can be resolved via this simple request rather than via a formal legal process.
