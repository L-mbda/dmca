**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**  
  
I am the [private] [private] of the software project "HexViewer", published under the GPLv3+ license on GitHub. [private] created the source code, documentation, and translations, and [private] hold the copyright to the original work.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**  
  
"HexViewer" is an open-source Android application licensed under GPLv3+. It includes source code files with copyright and license headers, a README file acknowledging contributors, and a settings configuration linking to the original project.  
  
The infringing repository has removed copyright and license headers from the .java files, erased contributor acknowledgments from the README.md, and redistributed the app via Google Play Store without providing proper access to the corresponding source code.  
Additionally, the app’s settings still point to [private] original repository, misleading users and violating section 6 of the GPLv3+.  
  
**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**  
  
https://github.com/keidan/HexViewer  
  
**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**  
  
**Based on the above, I confirm that:**  
  
The entire repository is infringing  
  
**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**  
  
Yes  
  
**Which license?**  
  
gnu-general-public-license-v3.0  
  
**How do you believe the license is being violated?**  
  
The repository at https://github.com/royt93/4_HexViewer includes code originally published under the GPLv3+ license.  
Although the LICENSE file is present, the author has removed all copyright and license headers from the .java source files, violating section 5 of the GPLv3+.  
The README.md file has also been stripped of contributor information, removing proper attribution and misleading users about the origin of the project.  
  
Furthermore, the application built from this code is distributed via the Google Play Store, but its internal settings still point to [private] original repository, meaning users are not provided with the correct source code for the distributed version — violating section 6 of the GPLv3+.  
  
Additionally, while the repository is hosted under the account @royt93, the actual commits are made by another user, [private], which further obscures the origin and authorship of the code. This misrepresentation contributes to the lack of transparency and attribution required by the GPLv3+ license.  
  
**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**  
  
To bring the repository into compliance with the GPLv3+ license, the following changes must be made:  
- Restore all copyright and license headers in the .java source files.  
- Reintroduce proper attribution in the README.md, including the original contributors.  
- Clearly state that the project is based on [private] original work and provide a link to the original repository.  
- Ensure that all future modifications respect the terms of the GPLv3+, including transparency and preservation of notices.  
- Remove any references, links, or configuration defaults that point to [private] infrastructure, repositories, or services, and replace them with their own equivalents.
