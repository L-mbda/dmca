**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and copyright owner of the plugin Nexo, which [private] [private] and distribute as a paid product. The source code and compiled plugin are [private] original work, and [private] have not authorized anyone to redistribute or publish the source code.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original work is [private] plugin Nexo, a proprietary Minecraft server plugin that [private] created and sell privately. The plugin is distributed only in compiled JAR form to paying customers. The GitHub repository at https://github.com/MediumCraft/Nexo contains a decompiled and reuploaded version of [private] plugin’s source code without authorization. This constitutes copyright infringement because it reproduces and makes public [private] proprietary source code, which is normally unavailable and protected.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

The original repository is hosted [private] on [private] at: [private].  
Additionally, [private] plugin is distributed for sale at: [insert your plugin sales page URL, e.g., SpigotMC, Polymart, or your own website].

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/MediumCraft/Nexo.git

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Yes. The plugin Nexo is distributed only in compiled JAR form to paying customers. The original source code repository is [private] and accessible only to authorized accounts. [private] do not publish the source code or make it publicly downloadable. Distribution is limited to licensed users through private channels, and [private] do not authorize redistribution of the compiled JAR or any derived source. These measures ([private] [private] access controls and restricted distribution of compiled binaries) are intended to prevent public access to the original source code.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused repository appears to have been created by decompiling a distributed Nexo JAR, extracting source files from the decompiled output, and then publishing those files to a public GitHub repository. This reproduces the original source code (or substantially similar code) and effectively circumvents [private] access controls by converting a distributed compiled binary back into public source form. [private] did not authorize any party to decompile, reconstruct, or publish the source code.

Furthermore, evidence at this file and line (https://github.com/MediumCraft/Nexo/blob/master/Sources/languages/zh-CN.yml#L90)  
indicates that the uploaded source came from a leaked/pirated JAR, as it contains wording commonly inserted by piracy sites when stripping plugin fingerprints. This supports the conclusion that the infringing repository was not independently created, but rather directly derived from an unauthorized leak of [private] plugin’s compiled distribution.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
