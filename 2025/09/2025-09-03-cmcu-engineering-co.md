**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am an employee of [CMCU Engineering Co.,Ltd.] ['中机中联工程有限公司' as Chinese Company Name] and am authorized to act on its behalf in this matter. The copyrighted work was created by [private] and other employees of the company during the course of our employment. Under the "work made for hire" doctrine, [CMCU Engineering Co.,Ltd.] is the sole copyright owner.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The copyrighted work is a private, unpublished software project developed internally by [CMCU Engineering Co.,Ltd.] The project, known internally as "wz" consists of proprietary source code for company's management workflow.

This code is a trade secret, is not open source, and has never been licensed for public distribution. It contains confidential business logic, proprietary algorithms, and internal system configurations. The material is not intended for public release in any form.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

The original work is proprietary source code developed internally and is not published online. The code was accidentally and briefly exposed via a public GitHub repository created by one of our employees. This repository was immediately deleted upon discovery to contain the security breach, and unfortunately, we do not have a record of its exact URL.

However, the infringing repository, located at [https://github.com/suevip1/-wz-], is a direct and complete copy of our confidential source code.

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/suevip1/-wz-

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

https://github.com/suevip1/-wz-

**Based on the representative number of forks I have reviewed, I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository.**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No, we do not have the alleged infringer's contact information.

We have conducted a thorough review of the user's public GitHub profile page (https://github.com/suevip1) and were unable to find any contact details.

Specifically, the profile does not contain a public email address, a personal website, links to social media, or any stated company affiliation. The user also has no public commit history from which an email address could be obtained.

Due to the user's anonymity on the platform, we have no means of contacting them directly. Therefore, this DMCA notice is our only available recourse.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
