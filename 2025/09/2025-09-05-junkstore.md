I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

CRITICAL CLARIFICATION: This involves TWO separate codebases:  
1. Open-source base (BSD licensed): https://github.com/ebenbruyns/junkstore  
2. Proprietary paid extensions (NO LICENSE): Sold on Patreon/Ko-fi. The infringement
involves ONLY the proprietary extensions (#2 above).

I have taken fair use into consideration.

There is no license compliance issue because the infringed code HAS NO LICENSE. It is
proprietary commercial software protected by full copyright.

I am claiming that the entire repositories are infringing because they consist of 91% stolen
proprietary code with minimal original additions. The infringing repositories are:  
https://github.com/kergoth/JunkStore-Nile  
https://github.com/xSylla/JunkStore-Nile

Evidence of ownership is provided through sales platform links at

https://portal.junkstore.xyz/  
https://www.patreon.com/junkstore/shop  
https://ko-fi.com/s/d0f9d54b31  

The forensic patch analysis attached demonstrates systematic theft and rebranding of
proprietary code, providing mathematical proof that 91% of the published code (1,339 out of
1,466 lines) is [private] stolen work, with infringement beyond what repository comparison could
show.

This claim is related to content hosted on Github [private] have an open source project licensed
under BSD: https://github.com/ebenbruyns/junkstore (this is #1 and is not the code that is
being infringed upon).

[private] provide a paid component that extends the functionality and is source available. It can be
purchased from the following locations. This paid extension is what is being infringed upon.
The original work is proprietary, closed-source software not hosted on GitHub.

Additional evidence of willful infringement and deception: On July 28, 2025, xSylla falsely
claimed in [private] that they "made a plugin for the open source version" when they actually
copied [private] proprietary GOG extension code (which has no open-source version) and
rebranded it for Amazon. This demonstrates continued deception about the true source of
the stolen code.

[private]

User xSylla purchased this extension from [private] on the Ko-fi Platform:  
Name and email via paypal: [private] [private]

[private]

[private] gave them early access to version 2.0 on February 7, 2025. Version 2 is a paid
closed-source project with select parts as source available. In May 2025, during friendly
[private] discussions, they requested assistance to build their own extension. [private] helped them,
but since they based their extension on [private] proprietary GOG code (not publicly available), [private]
explicitly asked them to refrain from releasing it publicly as they do not have rights to do so.

[private]

[private]

Despite this agreement, on July 28, 2025, xSylla falsely claimed they "made a plugin for the
open source version" while posting the stolen code publicly.

[private]

On August 15, 2025, [private] released an Itch.io extension. xSylla immediately asked about the
open-source components, clearly intending further infringement.

[private]

[private] noticed on the 24th of August that they forked [private] main Junk Store repo so [private] was curious as
to what they were up to. [private] found this repo: https://github.com/xSylla/JunkStore-Nile which
contains the exact code they do not have rights to release.

[private]

[private] done an extensive forensic reconstruction starting from version 0.1.6 and created
patches to show how they systematically stole [private] work. [private] used the initial commit on their
repo to demonstrate the origin of the code. You will find 4 patch files attached:  
file_renames.patch  
Search_replace.patch  
Deletions.patch  
Additions.patch  

[private] split the patches to make it easier to verify [private] claims. File_renames.patch contains [private]
original works with the files renamed to match their naming. This will allow [private] to use it as a
baseline to use the git tool to demonstrate the infringement. You can verify this by inspecting
this file.

The second patch file is Search_replace.patch. This demonstrates that mechanical search
and replace was used to alter the code from Gog to Amazon, effectively creating a
rebranding.

The file deletion.patch contains code they mostly deleted or commented out. With the
exception of the commented out code this does not really infringe, thus it's separated.

The last file, additions.patch contains somewhat original code, but [private] might be able to further
demonstrate that a large part of this was lifted from the v2 source thatâ€™s available for the
functionality it replicates. The damning evidence for this is the inclusion of a flatpak build that
was not released by [private] at the time of upload.

Through forensic analysis, [private] have determined that 91% of the defendant's published work
(1,339 out of 1,466 lines) consists of [private] stolen proprietary code, with only 9% potentially
original contributions.

On August 25 2025 xSylla added a README file to the repo, this contains installation
instructions for others:

[private]

On August 25 2025 [private] noticed that the infringing repo was forked by another customer:

https://github.com/kergoth/JunkStore-Nile

This represents coordinated secondary infringement - kergoth is actively developing 'fixes'
on a codebase he knows to be stolen from a fellow paying customer, demonstrating willful
participation in copyright violation.

[private]

Who is already starting to make contributions on [private] stolen code base:

[private]

I request immediate takedown of both repositories and flagging of both accounts for willful
copyright infringement by paying customers who violated their commercial license
agreements.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I
am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right
that is allegedly infringed.
