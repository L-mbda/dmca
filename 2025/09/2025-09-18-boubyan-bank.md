**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am an authorized agent for Boubyan Bank. Our firm, SOCRadar, is engaged by the Bank to protect its intellectual property, including unpublished software source code. I am authorized to submit DMCA notices on the Bank’s behalf. A PoA document can be provided upon request.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The copyrighted work is proprietary, unpublished iOS application source code owned by Boubyan Bank. It consists of Swift files and an Xcode project implementing the Bank’s internal app architecture, including (by way of example) layers and modules commonly titled Core, Data, Domain/Models, and Presentation, as well as Swift source such as application bootstrap files, views, models, and UI/UITest targets. The work includes the selection, coordination, and arrangement of files, classes, and identifiers bearing the Bank’s “BBYN” naming convention. This codebase has never been open-sourced or licensed for public distribution.

Why this is infringing:  
The repository reproduces Boubyan Bank’s proprietary Swift/Xcode project without permission. It contains distinctive structure and filenames that mirror our internal codebase and conventions (e.g., Core, Data, Domain/Models, Presentation, and Swift files such as BbynTodoApp.swift, ContentView.swift, Item.swift, plus UITest targets BBYN_TODOTests/BBYN_TODOUTests using our “BBYN” naming). Boubyan Bank has not licensed this code under any open-source license, and no fair-use exception applies. Hosting and distributing this material publicly enables unauthorized copying, modification, and derivative use of our software.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**
