Re: DMCA Notification of Copyright Infringement

Dear Copyright Agent:  
1. Getty Images represents a variety of contributors (“Copyright Owner”) who have authorized us to act on their behalf for copyright infringement notification.

2. Infringements of one of our contributors’ photographs have been detected on the github.com website (and per Exhibit A below my signature):  
https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/OmniGen2/blob/main/assets/examples_subject.png  
https://vectorspacelab.github.io/OmniGen2/static/img/omnigen/video_2.mp4 (0:33 – 0:41 mark)

3. The infringed image appears here on the iStockphoto (owned by Getty Images) website:  
https://www.istockphoto.com/photo/portrait-of-young-happy-businessman-gm1161597081-
318350330

4. In order to fully comply with this notice, you must immediately remove the infringing image/s
represented by Getty Images.

5. Getty Images reserves all rights.

6. You are permitted to contact me and my contact information may be found at the conclusion of this
letter.

7. I have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by Copyright Owner, its licensing representatives, or the law. The information provided herein is accurate to the best of my knowledge, and under penalty of perjury, I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

8. This letter is an official notification under the provisions of Section 512(c) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to effect removal of the detected infringements. Please send to me prompt response indicating the actions you have taken to resolve this matter or if you require additional information.

Please note that Getty Images has considered Fair Use in this matter and can advise that the usage of our exclusive image in such a manner, without a license, does not constitute Fair Use.

The four factors to consider Fair Use are:  
the purpose and character of the use  
the nature of the copyrighted work  
the amount and substantiality of the portion taken the effect of the use upon the potential market  
The GitHub user at issue is publicly displaying the copyrighted work, without a license, in a circumstance that would require licensing from Getty Images, thus undermining the market value of the image. Further, the GitHub user's use of the image was to show how to manipulate a copyright holder's work without appropriate permission. The GitHub user has used almost the entirety of the image, which has merely had its right side cropped slightly.
