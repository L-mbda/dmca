Hello,

My name is [private] and I am the authorized representative on behalf of our client Saudi Water Authority. A website that your company hosts (according to WHOIS information) are infringing copyrights of our client Saudi Water Authority.

The unauthorized and infringing contents can be found on below URL which is using our client Saudi Water Authority copyrighted materials including the name, logo and official documents.

This e-mail is an official notification under Section 512(c) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (”DMCA”), and I seek the removal of the aforementioned infringing material from your servers. I request that you immediately notify the infringer of this notice and inform them of their duty to remove the infringing material immediately and notify them to cease any further posting of infringing material to your server in the future.

Please also be advised that law requires you, as a service provider, to remove or disable access to the infringing materials upon receiving this notice. Under US law a service provider, such as yourself, enjoys immunity from a copyright lawsuit provided that you act with deliberate speed to investigate and rectify ongoing copyright infringement. If service providers do not investigate and remove or disable the infringing material this immunity is lost. Therefore, in order for you to remain immune from a copyright infringement action, you will need to investigate and ultimately remove or otherwise disable the infringing material from your servers with all due speed should the direct infringer, your client, not comply immediately.

I am providing this notice in good faith and with the reasonable belief that rights my company owns are being infringed. Under penalty of perjury, I certify that the information contained in the notification is both true and accurate, and I have the authority to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright(s) involved.

Dear GitHub Team,

I am contacting you on behalf of my client, SWCC . We have identified that the repository located at:

https://github.com/Abdulaziz-Al-Hmed/azaz

contains a leaked system and proprietary code belonging to SWCC. This material was never intended for public release and its presence on GitHub exposes sensitive internal information that poses a security and operational risk to my client.

We request the immediate removal of this repository under GitHub’s Policy. This content constitutes an unauthorized disclosure of confidential information and must be taken down to protect SWCC’s security interests.

For clarity:

The repository contains proprietary system files that are confidential and owned by SWCC.

Continued public availability of this material endangers my client’s infrastructure.

We therefore respectfully request that GitHub disable or remove the repository as soon as possible.
