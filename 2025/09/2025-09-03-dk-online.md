Dear GitHub Support,

We are Masangsoft Inc, the official developer and publisher of the online game 'DK Online'.

It has come to our attention that a specific Github page is currently operating and promoting an unauthorized [private] [private] of "DK Online." This activity constitutes a direct infringement of our intellectual property rights and is a violation of copyright laws. This not only violates our copyright but is also being used to solicit financial sponsorship, which further exacerbates the damage being done to our legitimate business and our employees' creative work.

The infringing content is located at the following URL:  
https://suhatu.github.io/dkonline/index.html  
https://suhatu.github.io/dkonline/download.html

The following infringing actions have been identified:  
1. Unauthorized operation of a [private] [private] using our official game client and server files  
2. Recruitment and promotion of users through the Github page for the illegal server operation

We request that GitHub remove or disable access to the infringing content under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).  
The page hosts and distributes the DK Online client and related assets without permission. This content was copied from Masangsoft’s original work and is being used to promote an unauthorized private server.
