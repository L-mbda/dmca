I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter Notice.

[private] content has been mixed up in this DMCA notice simply because of the name. It appears the RetroBowl game by New Star Games (released in 2020) has gone through and found copies of its source on GitHub but in releasing this DMCA notice [private] 2007 XNA game was picked up simply by name.

The content is completely different from the New Star Games version and is from [private] original [private] ([private]) named "RetroBowl". [private] was in the process of restoring it using MonoGame for release on [private].

[private] original game was written in XNA for XBLA and released to the XBox 360 Console (for free) in 2007. [private] cannot however show any proof of this as that was 20 years ago and even looking through [private] and the [private] [private] cannot find evidence of the game released (we didn't do releases and there was no official source showing all of the games released on XBLA since these were independent titles from [private], not companies).

For some proof here is the initialization function from [private] original XNA source code:

[private]

I can provide a zip file of the entire XNA project if desired.

As well, [private] original game only featured 5 teams (Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, and Washington). Their game has multiple conferences (I guess) with different teams. Also [private] roster is made up of generic names from multiple positions. For example here's the data file for Washington:

[private]

If you look at the textures in the Content/Textures folder (specifically [private] and [private]) they are very different from the New Start Games football field. Also the other assets are similar but not the same and more detailed than the New Star Games version. The folder also contains the A, B, 1, 2, buttons for the XBox controller.

The gameplay is very different from the New Star Games version as the player chooses the football plays to pick from to run (shown by some of the .bmp and .dds files like [private] or [private]) and the movement of the football players is done automatically. The football game is not interactive like the New Star Games version.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.

**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/bsimser/retrobowl

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

I believe the takedown for [private] game was a mistake on the complaining party as a result of simply looking for any repository named "Retrobowl" to protect their original content. Had they looked at [private] content they would realize it was not their game.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**
