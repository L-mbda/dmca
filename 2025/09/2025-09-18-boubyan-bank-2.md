Authorized agent. SOCRadar is engaged by Boubyan Bank to protect against sophisticated cyber attacks. I’m authorized to submit DMCA notices on the Bank’s behalf. And we can provide you a PoA document in need. Boubyan Bank owns the copyrighted software code at issue.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

Proprietary, unpublished Next.js/TypeScript web application code developed for Boubyan Bank. The work includes project configuration and source files (e.g., next.config.ts, package.json, tsconfig.json, postcss.config.mjs, eslint.config.mjs, bun.lockb), application code under /src, static assets under /public, and a Git submodule reference to an internal shared SDK (the bbyn-submodproj-shared package). The originality lies in Boubyan’s selection/coordination/arrangement of modules, components, build configuration, and the integrated shared SDK. This codebase has never been open-sourced or licensed for public distribution.
