Forks review statement (per GitHub guidance):   
At the time of submission (September 23, 2025), we have investigated each repository’s fork network and identified zero (0) forks for each of the above. If any forks exist at the time GitHub processes this notice, they will contain the same infringing content; we therefore allege those forks are also infringing and request they be disabled.

Please disable public access to and remove the above repositories (and any forks present when you process this notice). The user must not republish AIS’s proprietary code or documentation on GitHub or elsewhere without AIS’s express written authorization.
