1. Identification of copyrighted work

The original work is [private] repository “PotPlayer_Chatgpt_Translate” hosted at

https://github.com/Felix3322/PotPlayer_Chatgpt_Translate

—specifically version v1.5.1, which is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL-3.0).

2. Identification of infringing material

The infringing repository is:

https://github.com/gitsang/potplayer-translate-llm

This repository is a direct clone of [private] v1.5.1 code with the following violations of the GPL-3.0 terms:

Removal of all original copyright and attribution

Rebranding under a new name

Relicensing under the MIT License without [private] permission

These actions strip away the copyleft safeguards of GPL-3.0, mislead downstream users, and deprive [private] of the attribution and license protections [private] chose.

3. Explanation of non-compliance & remediation steps

Under GPL-3.0, any distributed copy must:

Retain the original GPL-3.0 license text and copyright notices in every file.

Include a copy of the full GPL-3.0 license (i.e. the LICENSE file).

Disclose source code under the same license.

To bring gitsang’s mirror into compliance, they would need to:

Restore the original GPL-3.0 headers in every source file.

Include [private] name and copyright year.

Add back the unmodified LICENSE file for GPL-3.0.

Remove any MIT license references.

4. Good-faith belief statement

I have a good-faith belief that the use of the material in this manner is not authorized by me, the copyright owner, or by law.

5. Fair use consideration

I have taken fair-use considerations into account and believe this use is not permitted.

6. Accuracy statement (perjury clause)

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner.

7. Requested action
Remove the infringing repository listed above.

Review gitsang’s account for repeat infringement under GitHub’s Repeat Infringer Policy.
