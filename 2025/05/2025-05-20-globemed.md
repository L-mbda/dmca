**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am an authorized representative of GlobeMed Group and have the authority to act on the company's behalf in matters related to intellectual property and copyright.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original copyrighted work in question is the source code and associated assets of the GlobeMed Fit mobile application, developed and owned by GlobeMed Group. This includes but is not limited to the application's user interface, functionality, design elements, and underlying codebase.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mcsaatchi.gmfit

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The GlobeMed Fit application is distributed exclusively through the Google Play Store, which includes access control measures such as user account verification and platform-level restrictions. Additionally, the app implements user authentication (login required) to access its features and content. Sensitive parts of the source code are protected through code obfuscation and secure API communication, preventing unauthorized access, reverse engineering, or reuse of copyrighted components.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project appears to reproduce significant portions of the GlobeMed Fit application’s source code and structure outside of the official, protected distribution channel (Google Play). By making the code publicly available on GitHub, it bypasses the access controls, authentication mechanisms, and code obfuscation measures implemented in the original app. This unauthorized publication allows third parties to access, reuse, and potentially redistribute proprietary content without going through our controlled and secured environment.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately. Please read more about forks. As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken fair use into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice.**
