Dear GitHub DMCA Team,

I have read and understand GitHub’s Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I am writing to formally request the immediate removal of content hosted on GitHub that infringes upon [private] intellectual property rights. The repository in question contains source code derived from the unauthorized reverse engineering of [private] proprietary, closed-source software, "SEU exercise," in direct violation of [private] software license.

**Infringing Repository:**  
Repository URL: https://github.com/leostudiooo/OpenSEUExercise  
Related Issue Acknowledging Reverse Engineering: [private]

As evidenced by the above-linked issue, the infringer explicitly admits to reverse engineering [private] software and republishing it. Specifically, they state: "为是以逆其加密，析其结构，复其原貌，重构开源于 Open SEU Exercise。" This translates directly to: "Hence, I reversed its encryption, analyzed its structure, restored its original form, and restructured it as open-source in Open SEU Exercise." This is a clear admission of unauthorized reverse engineering.

I have investigated all known forks of the repository https://github.com/leostudiooo/OpenSEUExercise and have determined that each also infringes on [private] copyright to the same extent. Therefore, I request removal of the following infringing forks:

https://github.com/Davidwadesmith/OpenSEUExercise  
https://github.com/harkerhand/OpenSEUExercise  
https://github.com/leowrs/OpenSEUExercise  
https://github.com/Wudji/OpenSEUExercise  

I confirm that I have examined each fork and that the statements in this notice apply to all identified repositories.

**Original Work:**  
The original copyrighted work is a proprietary software program named "SEU exercise," designed to streamline the process for students at Southeast University to upload exercise data directly to the university's servers, circumventing the official [private] mini-program. This software was developed to address issues such as server lag, instability, and UI limitations experienced with the official mini-program. "SEU exercise" includes [private] original and unique implementations for secure data transmission, authentication protocols, and data format encoding, none of which are standard or publicly available. The software’s core functionality, architecture, algorithms, user interface, data handling methods, and documentation are [private] original creations. The software has been continuously developed and refined since March 21st, as shown by the attached git commit history from [private] private [private]. The source code is confidential and not publicly available.

The software is distributed under a license that explicitly prohibits reverse engineering, decompilation, disassembly, and redistribution of the code or any derivative works.

**Evidence of Infringement:**  
I am providing the following evidence to support [private] claim:

- **Original Development Records ([private])**: Chronological Git commit logs from [private] private [private], establishing ownership and original development.
- **License Agreement (LICENSE):** The license file outlining the prohibition of reverse engineering and redistribution.
- **Code Comparison ([private]):** Compelling evidence of substantial similarity demonstrating the infringing code is a direct derivative of [private] proprietary software obtained via unauthorized reverse engineering.

**Remedy:**  
I request the complete removal of the entire repository https://github.com/leostudiooo/OpenSEUExercise and all its forks, including but not limited to those listed above. The infringing material is entirely based on unauthorized reverse engineering; partial removal is insufficient.

**Contact Information:**  
Full Legal Name: [private]  
Address: [private]  
Phone Number: [private]  
Email Address: [private]  

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing repositories is not authorized by me, the copyright owner, or the law. I have considered fair use and determined it does not apply.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Sincerely,  
[private]  
Date: [private]
