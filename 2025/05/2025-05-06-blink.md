**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] of Blink Consulting and the legal copyright holder of the source code in question. The code was developed under a work-for-hire agreement by contractors engaged through [private]. As per [private]’s default intellectual property terms and our signed employment agreements, including an NDA, non-compete, and non-solicitation agreement, all rights to the work are owned by Blink. The contractors have no rights to use, share, or publish any portion of the code.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The infringed work consists of proprietary web application and website source code developed by Blink Consulting for commercial use. This includes front-end components, application logic, styling, integrations, configurations, and API connectivity used in client-facing digital products. The code was written for real-world client projects currently in production and staging, and it exists in [private] inside our [private] (`[private]`).

The code (across multiple repos) includes references to our company name ("blink") in its structure and internal documentation, as well as references to the clients and live domains we built these solutions for. Its unauthorized exposure creates reputational, legal, and financial risk to both our business and our clients.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

No. The original source code was never publicly accessible and has only existed within [private] in our [private] (`[private]`).

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/xxx839/projects
https://github.com/xxx839/solrev
https://github.com/xxx839/lsdr

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Yes. The source code was stored exclusively in [private] within our [private] (`[private]`). We used GitHub’s access control features to restrict visibility and collaboration to only authorized users on a per-project basis. Contractors were granted limited access during their engagement, and that access was revoked upon project completion or termination.

All [private] were set to private, protected by GitHub’s permissions infrastructure, and inaccessible without explicit invitation. These measures effectively restricted access to only active team members and protected the confidentiality of our proprietary code.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused individual circumvented our technological protection measures by copying the proprietary source code during their limited-time authorized access, and then re-uploading it to a new GitHub account after their permissions had been revoked.

By doing this, they bypassed the controls and restrictions of our private GitHub environment, defeated the access limitations we had in place, and published the protected code publicly without authorization.

This circumvention was intentional: the individual created a new GitHub account to avoid detection, and the public repositories include direct references to our company name ("blink") and our client projects, confirming the origin and unauthorized nature of the material. Their actions represent a deliberate breach of both technological safeguards and legally binding agreements including an NDA, non-compete, and non-solicitation clause.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Other Change

**Describe the change.**

The immediate and permanent removal of all infringing repositories from GitHub, including any forks or duplicates, as well as the suspension or termination of the GitHub account used to upload the stolen content.

The content was posted with the intent to cause reputational and financial harm to my business and clients, in violation of copyright law, GitHub’s Terms of Service, and DMCA regulations. The repositories contain stolen code and direct references to my company and client projects. Allowing them to remain public even briefly amplifies the damage.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
