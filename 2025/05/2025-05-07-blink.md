**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am authorized to act on behalf of Blink Development LLC, the exclusive copyright owner of the material in question. The source code was created under a work-for-hire relationship with full transfer of intellectual property rights to Blink Development LLC. All rights, title, and interest in the work reside with the company. The material was never licensed or authorized for public distribution. I am submitting this notice in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), 17 U.S.C. § 512, and GitHub’s copyright policies.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The material includes proprietary source code, architecture, and integrations developed by Blink Development LLC for use in client-facing software systems. This codebase includes confidential application logic, front-end and back-end modules, API integrations, internal configuration files, and deployment tooling. The code was developed exclusively for our commercial use and has never been made publicly available.

The repositories in question contain direct references to our company name (“Blink”) and projects belonging to our clients. The public disclosure of this source code presents immediate harm to our intellectual property, operations, and client relationships.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The original source code was stored in [private] within the [private]. Access was strictly limited to authorized collaborators through GitHub’s access control systems. Private [private] were protected using role-based permissions, and access was revoked immediately upon termination of access rights. These measures ensured that only designated personnel had visibility into our proprietary codebase.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The infringing user retained unauthorized offline copies of our proprietary source code and uploaded them to a newly created GitHub account. This action directly bypassed the restrictions of our [private], including access revocation and organizational permission boundaries.

The code was copied without authorization and then made publicly available, with the intention of exposing confidential business materials and client-specific implementations. This constitutes a clear circumvention of both technological and legal protections.
