Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am an authorized representative of Playnetic Ltd, the copyright owner of the software code in question. The code was developed by our internal engineering team and contractors under exclusive contractual agreements, including NDAs and intellectual property assignment clauses. The copyright for all such code belongs solely to Playnetic Ltd.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The copyrighted work consists of proprietary backend source code for one of our commercial software systems. It includes application logic, configuration files, API endpoints, and deployment structures that were originally stored in our company’s [private] [private] [private]. The work was developed over time by authorized employees and contractors of Playnetic Ltd, and has never been licensed or released to the public.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

The original work is not publicly available. It is hosted in a [private] [private] [private] maintained by Playnetic Ltd and is accessible only to authorized team members under NDA. If needed for verification, we are willing to provide secure, read-only access to GitHub Trust & Safety for comparison purposes.

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/staffengineer0217/techtellent-main-backend-service

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Playnetic Ltd uses [private] [private] [private] with strict access controls. Only authorized users with two-factor authentication (2FA) and internal company credentials can access source code. Access is governed by project-level permissions, and all external collaborators are bound by signed NDAs and IP clauses. Repository access logs and audit trails are maintained. No repositories containing production or backend code are made public under any circumstances.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project was cloned and downloaded locally by a former contractor who had temporary access to the [private] [private] [private] under an NDA and contractual limitations. The publication of this code on a public GitHub repository circumvents our access controls by making proprietary content available to anyone online—without permission, security, or tracking. This bypasses our authentication system, security measures, and legal agreements intended to protect this content.
