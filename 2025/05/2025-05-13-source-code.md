**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

Part of a licensed software was included in a release zip file in GitHub repository.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

In the repository https://github.com/Hynopsia/PMDG-Livery-Installer I have found a ptp_converter.exe - an integral part of a larger application developed for one of [private] customers.

The exe file is digitally signed by [private] ([private], [private]), is protected by intellectual property rights and redistribution is prohibited. It's not directly available to anyone for download and must be extracted from application installation directories.

File is present and possible to download in multiple commits and releases on the repository. I demand it being completely removed from this repository (including all commits, tags, branches and releases) and to be completely removed from GitHub servers.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

Specific files within the repository are infringing

**Identify only the specific file URLs within the repository that is infringing:**

File ptp_converter.exe in general available under these links (and possibly more):  
https://github.com/Hynopsia/PMDG-Livery-Installer/blob/ptp/ptp_converter.exe
