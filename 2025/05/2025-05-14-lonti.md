I am the [private] & [private] ([private]) of Lonti.com Pty Ltd (formerly Toro Cloud Pty Ltd), an Australian company incorporated under company number 643 086 024, which owns all rights, title, and interest in the proprietary software product known as Martini Designer.  
Lonti.com Pty Ltd is the exclusive creator, publisher, and licensor of Martini Designer and has never authorized the public distribution of its source code.  
As [private] & [private], I am authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner in enforcing our intellectual property rights, including submitting this DMCA takedown request.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original copyrighted work is the software product known as Martini Designer, developed, owned, and published by Lonti.com Pty Ltd (formerly Toro Cloud Pty Ltd), an Australian company incorporated under company number 643 086 024.  
Martini Designer is a proprietary, closed-source low-code development environment used to design APIs, integrations, and business applications. It is a key component of the Martini platform, which is promoted at https://lonti.com/martini.  
Martini Designer has never been released under an open-source license or authorized for public distribution. All rights are reserved by Lonti.com Pty Ltd, and its use is governed by the Master Subscription Agreement available at https://static.lonti.com/legal/master-subscription-agreement.pdf.  
The software is also protected under trademark law, with "Martini" being a registered trademark of Lonti.com Pty Ltd (U.S. Serial Number 97088704).  
The unauthorized GitHub repository contains direct copies of substantial portions of the source code, user interface elements, internal logic, and structure of Martini Designer, all of which are original and proprietary to Lonti.com Pty Ltd.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

The original work, Martini Designer, is a proprietary closed-source product and is not available online in source code form.

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Martini Designer is distributed exclusively as a compiled, closed-source software application, with no access to the source code provided to end users. Access to the software requires a valid subscription and authentication through our secure licensing and user management systems.  
Access is further restricted under the terms of our Master Subscription Agreement (https://static.lonti.com/legal/master-subscription-agreement.pdf), which legally prohibits reverse engineering, copying, or redistribution of the software.  
The source code is stored securely in internal, access-controlled [private] that are only accessible by authorized personnel under strict confidentiality obligations.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project circumvents our technological protection measures by publicly posting the source code of Martini Designer, which is not made available to customers or the public under any circumstances.  
By doing so, it bypasses our measures of restricting access through compiled distribution, subscription-based access controls, and contractual prohibitions against reverse engineering or redistribution.  
The unauthorized publication of the source code defeats the protections we have in place to keep the code confidential, allowing anyone to access, use, and distribute our proprietary software without authorization.
