GitHub  
  
**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**  
  
I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. I'm one of [private] of VMProtect (https://vmpsoft.com). Someone has published of our VMProtect's sources on the Internet and after that many of Github's users published these sources in own repositories. Based on the representative number of forks I have reviewed, I believe that all of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**  
  
The software published on our website is signed with [private] personal code signing certificate.  
  
**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**  
  
https://vmpsoft.com  
  
**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**  
  
**Based on the above, I confirm that:**  
  
The entire repository is infringing  
  
**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**
