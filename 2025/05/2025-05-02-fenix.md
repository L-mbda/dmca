Fenix International Limited (“Fenix”), owner and operator of the website https://onlyfans.com (“OnlyFans”) has recently become aware that GitHub is hosting repositories with coding that is specifically designed to circumvent Fenix’s digital rights management (“DRM”) protections.

OnlyFans Creators own the intellectual property rights in all content which they choose to post on OnlyFans, and each Creator grants Fenix a license to host their content.

Please note that has, in parallel to this takedown request, submitted a letter to [private] ([private]) by email to [private] and [private].

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The identified repositories contain step-by-step instructions which are specifically designed to circumvent the DRM protections in place on OnlyFans. The repositories contain links that are “hard-coded” and specifically targeted at OnlyFans.

The coding is designed to impersonate a video player in order to decrypt and play DRM protected files, obtaining the “secret” token required to play the DRM protected content. The downloaded files are then converted into an MP4 format which has the DRM protection removed.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

https://onlyfans.com

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Fenix has implemented DRM protections, and secure URLs, to ensure that Creator content is not illegally copied and that only authenticated users are authorized to view Creator content.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

As described above, the identified repositories contain step-by-step instructions which are specifically designed to circumvent the DRM protections in place on OnlyFans. The repositories contain links that are “hard-coded” and specifically targeted at OnlyFans.

Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

Based on the representative number of forks I have reviewed, I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository.
