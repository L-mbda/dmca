I've already send a request about this person's (https://github.com/IrinaOre) behavior , but then I've found another works of this person, which were also stolen from [private] own repository. So, the same situation repeats.
[private] own work is currently here - [[https://github.com/Professor-Severus-Snape/AHJ_http-frontend](https://github.com/Professor-Severus-Snape/AHJ_https-frontend)](https://github.com/Professor-Severus-Snape/AHJ_https-frontend), it was created about 8 month ago, it has MIT LICENSE and [private] own structure and content of src directory. It also has [private] own version of .appveyor.yml with [private] comments, [private] own structure of webpack config files.
The server/ directory was also stolen from [private] another repository - ([https://github.com/Professor-Severus-Snape/AHJ_http-backend/blob/main/server.js)](https://github.com/Professor-Severus-Snape/AHJ_https-backend/blob/main/server.js)) and was added to these person's repositories.

All first commit of these two repositories of this user has [private] own code, which was just a little bit added and changed in next commits.  
Stolen works are:  
1. [invalid]   
2. https://github.com/IrinaOre/ahj7_frontend

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

https://github.com/Professor-Severus-Snape/AHJ_http-frontend

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

[invalid]

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

mit-license

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

There is no any link to [private] own work and no license in the stolen repositories.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

This person (https://github.com/IrinaOre) should provide a link to [private] own work and add a license or remove these repositories completely.

**Do you have the alleged infringerâ€™s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**
