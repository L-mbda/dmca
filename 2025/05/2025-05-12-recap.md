Recap is a AI-powered quiz generation app powered by Gemini, written in Swift and SwiftUI.

The infringing repository's code was duplicated from the original TopGApps/Recap repository, and the Git commit history was manipulated to remove [private] contributions, along with a taunting message accusing [private], with contributing to the original repository of having a fraudulent repository, which is not true, in the infringing repository’s README.md. Also, the infringing repository also builds upon the original “[private]” project, which was originally submitted by [private] to a hackathon in 2024: [private]

Additionally, comparing the initial commits of both repos, in ‎[private] line #288 of the original TopGApps/Recap repository, it contains [private] `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER`, while the infringing repository removes [private] `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER`, but on line #275 contains [private] Xcode `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM`, which I can prove is owned by [private], as it is also used in a iOS project that [private] published on GitHub on December 9, 2023, before the initial Recap repository commit date of on May 25, 2024: [private].

Lastly, comparing the creation dates of both repos shows that the original TopGApps/Recap repository was created on 2024-05-25[private], whereas the infringing repository was created on 2025-03-01[private], with the Git commit history fraudulently modified.
