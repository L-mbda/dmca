Greetings, I am the [private] at AuraSide, the parent company of Hone.gg

I was authorized by [private] [private] & [private] of both Hone & AuraSide to submit this takedown request.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

These GitHub repos, including the forks, infringe upon Hone and our private property. Hone is both copyrighted and trademarked. They are offering our services for free, that are normally blocked by a paywall to access the optimizations we put hard work into. I ask on behalf of AuraSide and our product that this repo and the forks be removed immediately.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

https://hone.gg

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing
