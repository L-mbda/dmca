I am the [private] of Ngari Health Technology Co., Ltd., the copyright owner. I have the authority to identify instances of copyright infringement, submit notices under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), and participate in any necessary legal proceedings to protect the rights and interests of the copyright owner. The scope of my authorization includes the power to demand the removal of infringing content and pursue appropriate remedies against infringers.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

This project has been owned by our company since 2016. The project code contains our company's identification mark "ngarihealth", which is the information of our company's domain name (ngarihealth.com). A former employee of our company uploaded the project code. We have already contacted this person and asked them to take down the project code. However, other users on GitHub forked the code, and we are unable to contact these users to ask for its deletion. We can provide the information of the project contributors and the records of submitted branches. All the project contributors are employees of our company.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

[private]

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Firstly, this is a private VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) network, and the code repository can only be accessed within the internal network of the VPC.
Secondly, we have implemented permission restrictions, so that employees who are not part of the project are unable to access the code.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

This project forked the code records uploaded by a former employee. We have already contacted the former employee and asked them to delete the project. However, we are unable to deal with the forked part.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

https://github.com/suevip1/ehealth-recipe-parent

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

no,I don't know alleged infringer's contact

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
