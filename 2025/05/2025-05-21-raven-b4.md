**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and [private] of the proprietary software "Raven B4". I am submitting this takedown on behalf of my organization, which distributes this software commercially.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

Raven B4 is a paid, closed-source Minecraft modification ("client") that [private] originally developed and continue to maintain. It enhances Minecraft gameplay with advanced features such as automation, visual enhancements, and utility modules. It is proprietary software that has never been publicly released as source code or under any open-source license. Raven B4 is distributed exclusively through our [private] [private] server to verified customers who have purchased a license.

The software is promoted on our official [private] at [private], where users can also find a link to our [private] in the video descriptions to inquire about purchasing access. We also advertise Raven B4 on a second channel at [private], which links directly to our sales [private] at [private].

A third-party project hosted at https://github.com/Strangerrrs/Raven-bS and called “Raven bS” has published a version of Raven B4 that is based on decompiled and deobfuscated proprietary source code. The repository's README openly admits this by stating:

“Raven B4, but for those who can't afford it, or too paranoid to get it… based off b3, with the help of b4 src.”

This is a clear acknowledgement that the codebase was derived from unauthorized access to Raven B4’s source code. Additionally, the Raven bS [private] server (linked directly from the GitHub README: [private]) includes a message from the [private], “[private],” who explicitly states in the FAQ:

“b4 src refers to decompiled, deobfuscated, and remapped Raven b4 Update 2 code.”

This is a direct admission that the developer used illegally obtained source code from Raven B4, which was leaked and deobfuscated from a cracked version publicly posted at [private]. A screenshot of this admission is available at: [private].

The features, structure, and naming conventions of the “Raven bS” repository are substantially similar to Raven B4, reinforcing that it is a derivative, unauthorized version of our protected software.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/Strangerrrs/Raven-bS

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

We use a Hardware ID (HWID)-based authentication system to control access to our software. When a user purchases Raven B4, their unique HWID is whitelisted and stored in our secure database. Our custom loader verifies the user's HWID during login, and only if the HWID is authorized the client is loaded from our server. Our API servers, which handle authentication and validation, are hosted at https://daikirai.xyz/ for this purpose. In addition, the software is protected using code obfuscation to prevent reverse engineering and tampering.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project has knowingly and deliberately circumvented our technological protection measures by using a decompiled and deobfuscated version of Raven B4’s proprietary source code — obtained without authorization through a cracked leak. In the process, they have completely removed our HWID-based authentication system, which is used to verify legitimate users and prevent unauthorized access. They have also stripped all obfuscation layers that were implemented to prevent reverse engineering and code tampering.

These actions have effectively disabled the core mechanisms we use to protect Raven B4 against piracy. The modified version, rebranded as “Raven bS,” is being publicly distributed on GitHub, allowing unrestricted access to what is essentially a pirated copy of our paid software. This not only enables widespread, unauthorized use but also allows others to build upon and redistribute our stolen intellectual property, further compounding the infringement.

The project's README and developer statements in the associated Discord server explicitly confirm that they used "decompiled, deobfuscated, and remapped Raven B4 Update 2 code" to create their version, fully acknowledging that they bypassed our protection mechanisms to repurpose and redistribute stolen code.
