Hello,  
  
We, Marq Vision Inc., are submitting this DMCA takedown notice on behalf of Smilegate Entertainment, Inc. (hereinafter “IP Owner”). The IP Owner developed the widely recognized FPS game “CrossFire,” and holds all intellectual property rights associated with the “CrossFire” brand, including but not limited to trademarks, logos, game code, graphics, and related assets. Authorized uses of these intellectual property rights can be found on the official website:  
https://crossfire.z8games.com  
  
1. Alleged Infringing Repositories
   
We assert that the entire contents of the following GitHub repositories are infringing upon the IP Owner’s exclusive intellectual property rights:  
  
Repository 1:  
Entire Repository: https://github.com/crvvdev/titancf  
– This repository includes code files, scripts, and assets intended for creating or facilitating game cheats/hacks for “CrossFire.” Specific files, such as those containing game exploit code, are directly derived from the original game assets without authorization.  
  
Repository 2:  
Entire Repository: https://github.com/serjam/cfclap  
– Similarly, this repository contains unauthorized code and assets used to build game cheating tools that replicate key elements of the “CrossFire” game, infringing on the IP Owner’s protected works.  
  
2. Detailed Description of the Infringement  

The content in the above repositories infringes upon the IP Owner’s intellectual property rights in the following manner:  
  
Unauthorized Use of Game Code and Assets:  
Both repositories include the game’s proprietary code and related assets such as images, sound files, configuration files, and other materials. These elements are copied or closely derived from the original “CrossFire” game without permission from the IP Owner.  
  
Facilitation of Cheating/Hacking:  
The materials provided in these repositories are used for creating, distributing, or enabling game cheats and hacks, which not only bypasses the game’s security but also directly exploits the underlying copyrighted work. This unauthorized distribution results in a direct violation of the IP Owner’s exclusive rights.  
  
Extent of Infringement:  
We claim that the entire repositories listed above are infringing, as every part of these repositories—including code files, documentation, and associated assets—has been uploaded and maintained in violation of the IP Owner’s rights. Direct links to key files within the repositories are included to clearly illustrate the extent of the unauthorized content.  
  
3. Legal Declarations  

Under penalty of perjury, I declare that:  
  
I have a good faith belief that the materials described above have been uploaded, published, or distributed in a manner that is not authorized by the IP Owner, its agent, or by law.  
  
I am authorized to act on behalf of the IP Owner regarding the exclusive rights that have been infringed.  
  
I have read and understand GitHub’s DMCA Takedown Policy and the Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice.
