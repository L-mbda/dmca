I honestly cannot recall entering into any IP assignment agreement with the company, as the takedown notice states. If this is a mistake, please contact me with the executed agreement and I will withdraw this counter notice. Nonetheless, the software is under an MIT license, so the company is free to use it within those terms (which includes commercial uses).

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**

**Please confirm that you have you have read our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Counter Notice</a>.**
