I am the [private] of the "[private]" game project, which positions its servers in the Garry's mod game. The person who calls himself the "[private]", "Modular442", "[private]" has been purposefully trying to copy or steal [private] work for a long time. He created phishing [private] and [private] accounts with [private] nickname, [private] groups of [private] project, [private] server to get ahead of [private] reputation and project reputation. Lately, he's been trying to create his own gaming project "better than mine", and brazenly trying to steal all kinds of developments. For example, he has already created a parody of [private] project on another Github account [private]  
  
But now we are talking about the repository https://github.com/modular442/ModSynth-Framework which is positioned as "his own framework". No one has asked me for permission to use [private] files in other works, and [private] strongly do not want the "[private]" to use [private] files, since this person has already pretty much frayed [private] nerves.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**  
  
Here is an example of an Aabb class file on Lua language that [private] created for [private] game server project and this file was in [private] public repository [private]  
However, the latest modification is in 2020. Later, [private] made changes to this file in 2022, and [private] added [private] copyright there "[private]" [private]  
The latest version of files is sent to players in the Garry's mod game to the clients in encrypted form (by game). With the help of cheats and other illegal software you can extract encrypted client Lua files from the game cache. We see that the author is just using files stolen from the game with deleted copyright https://github.com/modular442/ModSynth-Framework/blob/5698fb8235afbf5f4db82a774744db783570f047/garrysmod/addons/core-mslib/lua/mslib/modules/aabb.lua  
And then he added its own copyright in commit https://github.com/modular442/ModSynth-Framework/commit/51d669719aa924173ebabebec20be58302343d07  
  
Here is another example of a Log wrapper file from 2023. [private] have not published it in the public repository, this file is also being sent to clients in game [private]  
We can see the author also just deleted the copyright from the stolen decrypted game file https://github.com/modular442/ModSynth-Framework/blob/main/garrysmod/addons/core-mslib/lua/mslib/modules/log.lua  
  
And another example of a Stack class file from 2022 [private]  
[private] also added [private] copyright later for game only file [private]  
The copyright also has been removed from the stolen decrypted game file https://github.com/modular442/ModSynth-Framework/blob/main/garrysmod/addons/core-mslib/lua/mslib/modules/stack.lua  
  
Another example of a Vector extensions [private]  
With a later copyright [private]  
The copyright has been removed from the stolen decrypted game file https://github.com/modular442/ModSynth-Framework/blob/main/garrysmod/addons/core-mslib/lua/mslib/modules/vector_ext.lua  
  
Also some other files. [private] did not allow them to be used, much less embedded in his project without any credits:
