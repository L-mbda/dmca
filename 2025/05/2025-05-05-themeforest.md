You can see where we sell it on ThemeForest here: https://themeforest.net/item/funeral-home-funeral-services-church-html-template/20633868

They are also publicly using our [private] on this page: https://github.com/hoshiyar459/Frontend-Website-Sample-Templates-For-Ecommerce/blob/0af0a4326b6fa76b649ffac6ce001a5abcc2da17/creamtion%20website/demo.themesuite.com/funeral/modern/locations.html

You can see they just scraped it at the bottom without a proper license: [private]
