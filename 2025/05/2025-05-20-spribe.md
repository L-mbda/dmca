Dear GitHub Trust & Safety Team,

I am writing on behalf of Spribe, a licensed software and gaming provider, to formally report an attempted extortion incident involving threats to publish unauthorized and potentially stolen data on GitHub.

Incident Summary:  
An individual identifying as [private] ([private] profile: [private], [private]: [private]) contacted our [private] via [private] and other platforms with the following threats:

Threats to leak source code, databases, and internal tools on GitHub. ([private])

Offers to "verify" stolen data by sending dumps.

Demands for a “good contract” and “small goodwill” payment in exchange for silence.

These threats constitute an extortion attempt and suggest that GitHub may be used as a platform to host or distribute stolen content — including potential database dumps, proxies, or code related to our intellectual property.

Requested Action:  
We respectfully request the following:

block any repositories created by or associated with the following aliases:

Username: [private]

Any usage of “Spribe”, “Aviator”, “Spribe Games API”, etc.

Flag and remove any existing or future repositories containing:

Spribe proprietary source code

Production or staging data related to Spribe platforms

Demo-game proxies or reverse-engineered assets

Notify us immediately if any content matching these criteria is published or if access logs indicate unauthorized uploads.

We are prepared to provide legal confirmation and identification if required. We take this matter seriously and are conducting a full security investigation.

Thank you for your attention and cooperation. Please let us know if you require further details or an official legal request.
