Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

This takedown request is about a fork of a previously taken-down repository. I please wish that GitHub also takes down this fork:

ðŸ‘‰ https://github.com/jmsole/Wall-Script by [private] @jmsole ðŸ‘ˆ

The already taken-down repo and the DMCA Takedown notice mail between [private] and GitHub has the subject "[private]" and here is it in the archives of DMCA. In the mail you have written:  
"The following content has been disabled and the owners have been notified of the takedown. We will let you know if any of the users file a counter notice to have the content re-enabled:  
[private]  
Please also note that, although your earlier reports did not identify any forked repositories, we thought you may want to know that at least one of the repositories in your takedown notice has been forked. You can see a list of those forked repositories at:  
https://github.com/jmsole/Wall-Script  
If you wish to have any of the files in the forks disabled as well, please investigate and report them in another notice, as they may often contain different material than in the parent repository. [...]"  

The fork I wish you to take down as well does not have any other files than the forked-from and taken-down repository. It has even most contributions by the same author [private]
([private]).

Here is the separate Takedown Notice in case that is also necessary:

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

[private] Original Plugin "Script Deck"

Published [private]

the plugin file repository that gets pulled into the Plugin Manager of GlyphsApp when installed  
PDF Manual for [private] Plugin  
[private] original plugin is a commercial application (users fay for the license) and that it is not open source. I think its important to know, as this puts the clone under a different light.

I have screenshots and the original takedown notice (that this reported repo is a fork of) at hand if needed. I also asked GitHub in the original takedown request to take down the fork, but I was asked to report it separately.

this is the fork of the already reported and taken-down ([private]) repository ([private])
