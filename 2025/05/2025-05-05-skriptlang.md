**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am a [private] to the project which means all the work [private] have contributed falls under the GNU license found here:
https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/blob/master/LICENSE

I also have a fork of the project, used for contributing, that has the same license, found here:

[private]

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. All personal information is redacted before being published to our public DMCA repository.**

The original repo, SkriptLang/Skript, holds a GNU license. I, [private] ([private] on GitHub), have been contributing to this project for several years. All work I have contributed falls under the GNU license the repo has.

My license is GNU V3.0, as found here:  
https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/blob/master/LICENSE

The infringing repo has uploaded a copy of the source code, without any of the git history. On top of that they have applied a secondary license which goes against the license we currently hold on the original repo.

They have applied a new license to their repo:  
https://github.com/kotlinsyntax/SkriptButBetter/blob/master/LICENSE-extra

This license goes against my original license.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

The repo I have a license on:  
https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

The following URL(s) are infringing:

https://github.com/kotlinsyntax/SkriptButBetter

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Each fork</a> is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately.</i> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork below:**

I do not believe there are any forks

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

gnu-general-public-license-v3.0

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The project I have committed to is licensed under GNU V3.0.  
They have re-uploaded all of our work, including my work, and applied a new BSD 3-Clause License, which goes against the terms of my license.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

The entirety of their repo breaks my license, best course of action would be to remove the repo, fork and start again.

To gain compliance with our license, they would have to re-upload the entire project including all git history, and removing their appended license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Select a response

**Do you have the alleged infringerâ€™s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

The best I can provide is their [private] id "[private]".  
They reached out to [private] on [private] telling [private] about the "fork".  
From there I found their GitHub link in their [private] profile, and came across said repo.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
