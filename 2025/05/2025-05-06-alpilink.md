I represent the interests of the company ALPILINK.

Formerly known as JB Concept, ALPILINK acquired, by a share transfer agreement dated December 21, 2022, all of the shares comprising the capital of the company XSALTO, which was then managed by [private].

Pursuant to the asset and liability guarantee agreement annexed to the share transfer agreement—and more specifically, Article 5 thereof—it is expressly stated in the clause entitled “IT systems” that:

“All IT systems used by the Company are in normal operating condition and are subject to appropriate maintenance. The Company validly owns all dedicated software or applications.”

The share transfer agreement therefore entailed the transfer of ownership of all of XSALTO’s assets, including rights to its software.
Among these assets is the software known as “Console Séolan,” of which ALPILINK became the full copyright holder.

[private], as the [private] of XSALTO, retained no intellectual property rights in this software, particularly in its source code, after the acquisition.

However, despite having no rights over the software, [private] published the source code of “Console Séolan” without authorization, releasing it as open source on his GitHub account on December 29, 2022, only nine days after the transfer of ownership.

This repository was accessible at the following link: [invalid].

This main repository was removed by GitHub following a complaint I filed on April 23, 2025. However, the original takedown notice did not mention any forks of the repository.

In the meantime, GitHub informed us in a message dated April 28, 2025, that it had identified three forks of the original repository.

These forks continue to host the infringing content, and we are hereby submitting this notice to address them.

We request that these forks be taken down, as they contain the same infringing code and are in violation of the rights ALPILINK holds over the software.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The infringed work is a proprietary software owned by ALPILINK, entitled “Console Séolan.” It is a modular content management and development framework written primarily in PHP, intended for building web applications. The software includes the original source code (version X, registered with the Agence pour la Protection des Programmes), architecture, and design developed specifically for XSALTO’s commercial activities.

All copyrights in this software, including the source code and associated documentation, were transferred to ALPILINK on December 21, 2022, as part of a universal transfer of assets following the acquisition of XSALTO.

There is no open source.

Published content may reveal security vulnerabilities and expose people to cyberattacks.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**
