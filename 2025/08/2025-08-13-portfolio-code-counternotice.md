**Please describe the nature of your content ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] [private] and [private] of the content hosted in the GitHub repository https://github.com/sahilraut05/Portfolio. [private] [private] developed the website and its associated source code using publicly available knowledge and resources. The design, code structure, and functionality were either original or based on elements that are freely available under open-source or public domain terms. At no point did I knowingly copy, clone, or replicate copyrighted material from any third-party source. Therefore, I am the rightful owner of the content [private] published, or I had the legal right to use and modify the elements included in [private] work.

**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

Yes. I believe the material was removed due to a misunderstanding or misidentification. The repository in question (https://github.com/sahilraut05/Portfolio) contains code that [private] either developed [private] or sourced from open, publicly available materials that did not contain any visible copyright or licensing restrictions at the time.

At no point did I knowingly copy any proprietary or copyrighted code. I did not fork the complainant’s repository, nor did I use any templates or assets directly from it. Any similarity is coincidental or based on common design patterns that are widely used in frontend development.

Furthermore, the complainant’s repository did not appear to include a license file clearly restricting reuse, which is essential for asserting copyright over code publicly posted on GitHub. Based on this, I believe the takedown was a mistake.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**
