3. Identify the material that you allege is infringing the copyrighted work listed in item #2, above:  
- https://github.com/gachupina753/siteSemInfrastruc/blob/main/Sc
The reported site, as can be seen in all the files it contains, is intended to create the official website of Sempra Infraestructura (https://semprainfrastructure.com/es/) without authorization from the organization. This could be exploited for phishing activities, fraud, and theft of information from end users. If you examine each file, you’ll see that the brand is mentioned—we’ve shared screenshots so you can verify this—and it occurs in all the files. It’s important to understand that this user does not have authorization to upload these types of files, which, as we’ve mentioned, are part of the official website code of Sempra Infraestructura and could be used for phishing and fraudulent purposes that harm end users.
