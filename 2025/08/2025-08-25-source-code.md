I am writing to request the removal of a forked repository that was created while our original repository was accidentally made public.

The original repository is:  
[private]

Due to an internal mistake by a [private], the repository was briefly made public before we noticed and changed its visibility back to private. During this time, it was forked by the following user:

Forked repository:  
https://github.com/tachRoutine/erp

The fork contains proprietary source code and internal material that was never intended for public access. We consider this a case of unintentional disclosure, and we are formally requesting GitHub's assistance in having the forked repository removed.

We are the legal and original owners of the code in question. Please let us know if any further information or proof of ownership is required to process this request.

Thank you for your time and support.

Best regards,

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Based on the representative number of forks I have reviewed, I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository.**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed
