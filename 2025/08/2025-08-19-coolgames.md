I submit this notice as a [private] of CoolGames Publishing B.V.. CoolGames is a leading HTML5 game developer and publisher based in [private]. CoolGames delivers popular titles such as Farm Merge Valley across social platforms.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

Farm Merge Valley is a proprietary video game developed and published by CoolGames, featuring unique game mechanics. The game includes original artwork, animations, user interface design, sound effects, music, character designs, and other audiovisual content, all of which are protected under copyright law.

Unauthorized Use of CoolGames' Copyrighted Content  
The repository contains in-game screenshots and images owned by CoolGames that are used without permission. This infringes CoolGames’ exclusive rights under 17 U.S.C. § 106 - including the rights to reproduce the work, prepare derivative works, distribute copies, publicly perform (where applicable), and publicly display the work - and constitutes copyright infringement under 17 U.S.C. § 501.

Violation of CoolGames Terms of Use - https://www.coolgames.com/terms-of-use/  
CoolGames’ Terms of Use strictly prohibit copying, modifying, or distributing game content except for limited, personal, non-commercial use. The repository’s use of our copyrighted images directly breaches these terms, constituting unauthorized use of our intellectual property.

Distribution of a cheating tool via code injection  
Although the tool may not bypass anti-cheat protections in a § 1201 sense, it is expressly designed to inject data into the game’s code to enable cheating. This is:  
- A prohibited modification of the licensed software under the Terms of Use, and  
- A clear example of a cheating tool, which GitHub’s own platform policies prohibit.

We urge GitHub to take immediate enforcement action by removing or disabling access to the repository at https://github.com/AstraaDev/FarmMergeValley-Injector (and related forks) on the following grounds:  
- Ongoing copyright infringement under 17 U.S.C. §§ 106 and 501,  
- Breach of CoolGames’ Terms of Use and license conditions, and  
- Distribution of a tool expressly intended to enable cheating in violation of GitHub’s own platform rules.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

Farm Merge Valley is a video game available on different social platforms such as [private], [private], etc.

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/AstraaDev/FarmMergeValley-Injector

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

We have implemented several technological measures to protect Farm Merge Valley and control access to our copyrighted material:
- Server-side processing: All core gameplay logic and progression systems are handled on secure servers, preventing unauthorized manipulation of game data from the client side.  
- Code obfuscation and encryption: Our game code is obfuscated and partially encrypted to hinder reverse engineering and tampering.
- Authentication and platform-level security: The game requires user authentication via trusted app platforms (e.g., [private]), which also enforce additional layers of protection.  
- Data validation and integrity checks: We use continuous verification of game data to detect and prevent the use of modified or corrupted game files.
- Anti-cheat mechanisms: We have systems in place to identify and flag abnormal activity or unauthorized tools used to alter gameplay.

These measures are designed to effectively safeguard our intellectual property and the player experience.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project is designed to circumvent our technological protection measures by providing tools, scripts, or instructions that allow users to alter or inject code into Farm Merge Valley. Specifically, it enables users to bypass our server-side validation and data integrity checks in order to gain unauthorized in-game advantages (e.g., unlimited resources, faster progression).

By doing so, the project directly undermines our anti-cheat systems and allows players to manipulate game mechanics that are otherwise protected by encrypted communication with our servers. This constitutes a clear circumvention of our technological measures, in violation of the DMCA’s anti-circumvention provisions.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>.
