**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

Live2D Inc. owns the copyright and I am an employee of the company.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

https://www.live2d.com/eula/live2d-proprietary-software-license-agreement_en.html

The repository is in violation of section 6.2 of our Live2D Cubism Core Proprietary Software License Agreement (EULA), as it distributes our Live2D Cubism Core for Web ("live2dcubismcore.min.js"). Section 5 specifies that redistribution is only permitted "to make the Derivative Work and Output File that are produced by using the Software available to the End Users." Section 1.1 defines an End User as "individuals or groups that ultimately use the Derivative Work and Output File." We have determined that because the repository is a kit intended to be used to create the Derivative Work, it is therefore not intended to be used only by End Users as defined in the agreement, and thus Section 5 does not apply to it. As the proprietary file is plainly distributed in the repository, it could easily be used by anyone for any purpose.

Sections of the License Agreement referenced:

"1.11 “End User” means individuals or groups that ultimately use the Derivative Work and Output File."

"5. Redistributable Code  
As set forth in this Agreement, the Software may include the codes that can be Redistributed by including them in the Derivative Work and Output File. If the Redistributable Code is included in the Software, the Customer may copy and Redistribute the Redistributable Code under the following conditions only to make the Derivative Work and Output File that are produced by using the Software available to the End Users."

"6.2 No Distribution, Disclosure or Bundling

Except as expressly permitted in this Agreement, the Customer may not distribute or disclose all or part of this Software, or bundle the same with the Derivative Work."

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories?

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Other Change

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No.
