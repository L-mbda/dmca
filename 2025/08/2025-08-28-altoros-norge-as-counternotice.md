**Are you the owner of the content that has been disabled, or authorized to act on the owner’s behalf?**

Yes, I am the content owner.

**Please describe the nature of your content ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and [private] of the organizational account and [private] setup everything we own in Github.  
I am the [private] for The Coring Company.

**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

Two repos have been struck by DMCA, they are;

https://github.com/thecoringcompany/scs_frontend  
https://github.com/thecoringcompany/scs_backend

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

The repositories have been blocked by DMCA due to unpaid invoices from [private].  
These invoices are now paid in full by us.

Additionally, [private] has sent us a new invoice for the interest accumulated from aforementioned invoices. We accept the invoice of interest and will pay this before the due date of September 5th 2025.

As the claim is based on our unpaid invoices, and not newly issued invoice for the interest, we believe that that DMCA claim should be dismissed as the scope of it has been resolved.

There are no on-going legal disputes on this matter and it is resolved amicable between the parties.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**
