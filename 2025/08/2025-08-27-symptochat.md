I am the [private] and copyright holder of the software project symptochat, which [private] first published on April 25th 2025 at https://github.com/benar-m/SymptoChat. The code was created by [private] and is protected under copyright law. The infringing repository contains a copy of [private] work that was uploaded without proper attribution and with the license information removed.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original copyrighted work is a software project titled "SymptoChat," which [private] developed and first published on April 25th 2025 at https://github.com/benar-m/SymptoChat. The project was created as part of [private] submission for a hackathon and represents [private] original work in both concept and implementation. The results for the hackathon are yet to be released and since they conduct plagiarism checks, I feel the infringing repository could jeopardise [private] results

SymptoChat is an AI-powered Conversational Symptom Assessor designed for preliminary symptom assessment. Users describe their symptoms in natural language, answer a targeted clarifying question, and receive a refined, ranked list of potential ailments for informational exploration. It is explicitly not intended as a diagnostic tool.

The project integrates a disease–symptom knowledge base with modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) and vector embeddings to semantically interpret user-reported symptoms, match them against potential conditions, and iteratively narrow down possibilities by asking differentiating questions. The system’s methodology includes knowledge base enhancement via large language models, embedding generation, semantic similarity search, and targeted clarification to refine output.

This work includes the source code, workflow design, and associated documentation that [private] authored. It was released publicly under the MIT license, which requires attribution and preservation of the license terms. The infringing repository contains a copy of [private] project uploaded without authorization, attribution, or license preservation.
