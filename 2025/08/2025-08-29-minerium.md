**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am [private], a representative of Minerium Inc., the legal owner of all intellectual property associated with the Minerium App. The source code in question was developed under Minerium’s employment and contractual agreements.  
The former developer who published this repository did so without authorization after their termination in 2022. As per our employment and contractor agreements, all intellectual property created during their engagement is fully owned by Minerium.  
Therefore, I am authorized to act on behalf of Minerium to protect and enforce our copyrights.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The copyrighted work is the Minerium React Native Mobile Application, developed exclusively by Minerium between 2021 and 2022.  
This work includes:  
Proprietary source code for the mobile app  
Custom UI/UX components and design assets  
Proprietary business logic related to Minerium’s Bitcoin mining platform  
Integration modules, API endpoints, and data handling methods  
This software was created by developers under employment and contractor agreements with Minerium, which grant full ownership of the source code and related intellectual property to the company.  
The repository at issue contains substantial portions of our original, proprietary code that have been published without our authorization by a former developer.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Minerium employs several technological and organizational measures to protect its proprietary source code and control access:  
All official Minerium repositories are hosted in private [private] and [private] repositories, accessible only via authenticated company accounts.  
Access is restricted using role-based permissions; only authorized employees and contractors are granted repository access.  
All developers sign IP assignment agreements and NDAs that legally bind them from sharing or publishing code.  
Access credentials are revoked immediately upon termination of employment or contract.  
We monitor our repositories and infrastructure for unauthorized activity to prevent leaks.  
The former developer who published this code did so after their termination in 2022, using a personal GitHub account. This unauthorized publication bypassed our access controls and was done without our knowledge or consent.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused repository contains our proprietary source code for the Minerium React Native Mobile and Web Application, which was unlawfully copied and published publicly by a former developer.  
Under normal circumstances, this code is stored in private repositories with strict access controls, including:  
Authentication via secured company accounts  
Role-based permissions restricting unauthorized downloads  
Automatic access revocation upon termination  
By publishing our private code to a public GitHub repository, the former developer circumvented these technological protections and made content available to anyone without authorization.  
The repository effectively bypasses our intended access controls by exposing code that should remain accessible only to authorized Minerium personnel.
