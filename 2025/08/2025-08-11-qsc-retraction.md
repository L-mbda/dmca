I am writing to formally retract part of my previous DMCA takedown notice, originally submitted on [Insert Date] concerning [Insert Description or Title of the Notice if you remember it].

Specifically, I wish to retract the following statements or claims:

"Violates the terms of the original license, with, in addition to AGPL, clearly states a 'no copy' and 'no reproduction' clause in every implementation header."  
"The original headers have a 'no copy' and 'no commercial use' clauses on top of the AGPL license. The actions of the parties involved violates the license, and the repository is an unlawful reproduction."  
"This is probably one of the most blatant rips of copyright that I have ever seen (and [private] have been writing open-source code for more than 30 years). This person's actions border on criminal IP theft. If it were up to me, their account would be revoked, and they would be banned from the platform."  

I have contacted the publishers of this repository, and they have provided evidence that their copy may be based on a version that does not have the 'no copyright' clause in the license header.

The other claims are to the best of my knowledge accurate, and the remainder of my original notice remains unchanged.
