**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

Yes, the material is 100% original, if you check you can see it's not the same as the "original source" and that is easy to distinct.  
Because the allign of the terminal is not the same, font size and lots more.  
Also the original source "[private]" was an inspiration, because the site owner told me NOBODY can replicate this. And i just prove him it's possible. If you have the slightest HTML/CSS/JS experience and a bit of AI prompting you can reproduce anything.  
[private] only mistake was that [private] wrote [private] in the preload and [private] will remove and reference to [private] [private] sorry about that.  
Also [private] is not a registered business and this is an abusive DMCA takedown.  
Because the difference between [private] and [private] is that [private] [private] a business "[private]" the business is also on [private], we are making SaaS apps and soon we'll public more source codes.  
So besides that [private] forgot to change the "[private]" in preload [private] [private] not interfering with his work and name.  
As soon as [private] repo will be reinstated [private] will remove the parts refering to him. [private] have solid proof the site is made from scratch.
