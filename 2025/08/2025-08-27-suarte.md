Identification of the protected work
I, [private], with [private], [private] I am the [private] of the source code of the platform “Suarte”, owned by Suarte Tech SLU. The work is contained in our [private] [private] [private] and [private] within the Suarte-Tech-SL organization on [private]. I can provide the original contracts, and source files that prove ownership and the date of creation.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

I am the copyright holder and [private] of the platform “Suarte”, developed and maintained by Suarte Tech SL. Our source code is stored exclusively in our [private] [private] on [private] under the organization Suarte-Tech-SL ([private]: [private] and [private], and more).

However, [private] recently received an email from Google Cloud Platform indicating that one of our confidential keys was found exposed at the following URL: https://github.com/at31oldfox/suarte-clone/blob/6b8bfab9d3c47c0010b887f9af920b08b0fc6e28/src/config/firebase.config.js

The user at31oldfox has created a repository named “suarte-clone”, which is an unauthorized and unlicensed copy of our project. This repository contains very sensitive and private information that should never have been made public. All of our official [private] are strictly [private], and no authorization has ever been given to publish, share, or clone our code.

Infringing material (URLs and scope)  
GitHub user at31oldfox has published an unauthorized and substantial copy of our repositories here (with it whole code):

https://github.com/at31oldfox/suarte-clone  
https://github.com/at31oldfox/suarte-clone/tree/main/src  
https://github.com/at31oldfox/suarte-clone/tree/main/public  
https://github.com/at31oldfox/suarte-clone/blob/main/package.json  
https://github.com/at31oldfox/suarte-clone/tree/main/server

This repository reproduces core functionality as it existed approximately one year ago, includes our proprietary icons and logos, and contains files with credential traces/configuration (e.g., Firebase frontend config), even though our active keys have been rotated. I can provide file-by-file matches, diffs, and SHAs upon request.

This constitutes:

Copyright infringement (unauthorized distribution of our code).  
Exposure of sensitive credentials and configuration files (posing a security risk to our systems, data, and users).  
Violation of our intellectual property rights and trade secrets.

I, [private], urgently request that the repository “suarte-clone” created by the user at31oldfox be taken down to protect our intellectual property and to prevent further security breaches.

The entire repository is infringing

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The source code for the Suarte platform is stored exclusively in [private] [private] [private] under the Suarte-Tech-SL organization. These repositories are protected by GitHub’s access controls and are only accessible to authorized team members. No part of the code is publicly available, and no authorization has been granted for third parties to copy, share, or publish the material. In addition, contractual confidentiality agreements with our developers reinforce these technological access restrictions.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The infringing repository “suarte-clone” created by the user at31oldfox circumvents our access restrictions by illegally copying and publishing material from our [private] [private] without authorization. By doing so, it exposes sensitive configuration files, including Firebase credentials, and effectively bypasses the private access controls and contractual protections that we have in place to safeguard our source code.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No
