The repository includes original code [private] authored in [languages used, e.g., JavaScript/TypeScript, Solidity], implementing smart contract deployment logic, backend API services, and frontend web application components.

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The original repository is hosted on [private] [private] [private] [private], which is protected by [private]’s authentication system, including username, password, and two-factor authentication. Only [private] have administrative access to publish or modify the repository. [private] control access by setting the repository’s visibility (public or private) and by granting permissions only to collaborators [private] authorize. These technological measures effectively restrict administrative control and ensure that any public availability of the code is under [private] [private] authorization.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project is a forked copy of [private] [private] [private] that was created and published without [private] authorization. By duplicating and re-publishing [private] code under a different account, the accused project circumvents [private] control over the original repository’s access permissions and ownership. In effect, it bypasses the technological protection measures of [private]’s authentication and permission system by reproducing [private] work outside the scope of [private] authorized repository and scraping for .env files.
