**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am authorized to act on behalf of RecoveryTools Inc., the copyright owner of the source code in question. We own all rights to this proprietary code, which was developed internally by our team.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original copyrighted work is the proprietary source code of RecoveryTools Inc.’s activation generator, a critical component of our software’s licensing system. This code has not been made publicly available

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

The original source code is proprietary and has never been published online. It exists solely within our internal development environment and is protected under copyright law.

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

Specific files within the repository are infringing

**Identify only the specific file URLs within the repository that is infringing:**

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Yes, our proprietary software includes technological measures such as license key verification, activation server validation, encryption, and hardware locking to control access and protect the software from unauthorized use

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project is specifically designed to circumvent our technological protection measures in the following ways:

Unauthorized License Key Generation:  
The accused project includes the source code of an activation generator, which is a proprietary tool used to validate and control access to our software. By hosting and distributing this activation generator, the project enables users to generate unauthorized license keys, bypassing our licensing and activation system.

Bypassing Server Validation:  
Our software uses a secure server-based validation mechanism to verify license keys during activation. The accused project allows users to bypass this process entirely by providing tools to generate keys locally, thereby negating the need for communication with our secure activation servers.

Reverse Engineering Proprietary Code:  
The repository includes decompiled and reverse-engineered versions of our proprietary source code, including forms, resources, and unit modules. This allows unauthorized users to analyze and exploit the logic of our software’s protection mechanisms.

Disabling Hardware Locking Features:  
Our licensing system incorporates hardware-based locking to ensure that licenses are tied to specific devices. The tools and code hosted in the repository circumvent this feature, allowing unrestricted use of our software across multiple devices without proper authorization.

Unlocking Paid Features Without Authorization:  
The project enables users to unlock premium or restricted features of our software, which are otherwise accessible only to legitimate users with valid licenses.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No, I do not have the alleged infringer’s contact information.
