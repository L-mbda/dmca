This is a website with partially my code that our company FMCA Filings, LLC paid [private] to code for us. He applied for the job through [private] on March 31st, 2025, and we paid him to finalize the code. We started having issues with [private] so he was terminated on June 5th, 2025. I have all screenshots of our conversations up to and including the code given to him to correct and him implementing it.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

It is the entirety of the project we paid him to complete. We own 100% of the rights to it based on [private] terms. He even used the beginning part of our company name "FMCA". We started the contract with [private] on March 31st, 2025, he was initially provided the code on April 1st, 2025. He was paid to make the code already available work better. The code was designed for our employees of the company to use as a tool to help for our main website fmcafilings.com. The tool is when a customer places an order through fmcafilings.com, our employees can go to fmca-generator.com, enter the customer's information and be provided a completely generated PDF copy of the customer's order that we can then submit to the US Department of Transportation. [private] is now posting all of our code online for our competitors to use.

fmca-generator.com and I also have screenshots and files of the original code and conversations with [private].
