**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and [private] of the Pake project (https://github.com/tw93/Pake), which is a tool that turns any webpage into a desktop app with Rust.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original work is Pake (https://github.com/tw93/Pake), a popular open-source project [private] created and maintain. It has over 40,000 stars on GitHub and is well-established in the community. The project includes:

Original source code for converting web pages into desktop applications  
Unique implementation architecture and design patterns  
Custom utilities and helper functions  
Project branding, including the name "Pake"  

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

https://github.com/tw93/Pake

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/Sjj1024/PakePlus

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

mit-license

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

[private] work is licensed under the MIT License. However, the infringing repository violates the license terms by:

Not providing proper attribution to the original work  
Creating confusion through the similar name "PakePlus" without acknowledgment  
Presenting the work as an independent creation rather than a derivative  

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

The best solution would be:

Proper attribution to the original Pake project in all documentation  
Changing the project name to avoid confusion ([private] previously requested this but received no response)  
Clear acknowledgment that this is a fork/derivative of Pake  
Compliance with the MIT License attribution requirements  

However, given the lack of response to [private] previous communication and the additional security concerns (detailed separately), I believe removal is appropriate.

**Do you have the alleged infringerâ€™s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
