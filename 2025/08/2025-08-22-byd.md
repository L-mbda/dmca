(2) Specific information description:

In February 2013, user bricksdev leaked the BYD warehouse management system code repository at the link https://github.com/bricksdev/trunk/blob/62be2f7a06ee8a547653c2dc2fa8a80b2afd50c0/BricksWebTest/web/templates/default/footer.jsp (Note: byd.com.cn is BYD's registered and filed domain name. BYD's English abbreviation is byd). BYD's internal security personnel have confirmed that this code contains sensitive internal BYD information. Furthermore, the leaked code is source code from a live system. Exposé on public platforms could be exploited by attackers at any time, potentially causing a serious security incident. We hope GitHub will assist in requesting the user to remove this repository.。 https://github.com/bricksdev/trunk/blob/62be2f7a06ee8a547653c2dc2fa8a80b2afd50c0/BricksWebTest/web/templates/default/footer.jsp
