Introduction  
  
I am writing on behalf of UK Biobank Limited (UK Biobank) and am authorized to act on behalf of the company in matters relating to intellectual property protection.    
  
UK Biobank is a large-scale biomedical database and research resource, containing in-depth genetic and health data that it has collected from half a million UK participants. As such, UK Biobank owns all intellectual property rights over all data collected. More information about UK Biobank can be found here: https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/learn-more-about-uk-biobank/about-us. This data is made available to bona-fide researchers who have successfully completed UK Biobank’s stringent application process to undertake health-related research.  
    
Researchers must sign UK Biobank’s non-negotiable Material Transfer Agreement located at [invalid], upon which a licence is granted to allow access to the data. Researchers can access the data via an account on our cloud platform, linked to each researcher’s individual registered account, or via a secure download using a unique time-limited encrypted key. These data (which, for the avoidance of doubt, does not include summary data and/or publications produced by researchers upon completion of their project) are not, under any circumstances, available for use on a public basis. Researchers have a contractual obligation to store the data securely and to not share data with any unauthorised third parties. By committing part, or all, of these data sets to a repository on GitHub, the user in question is in breach of their contractual agreement with UK Biobank.  
    
UK Biobank respects GitHub’s purpose and understands that sharing code creates potential for discovery in many fields. We actively encourage collaboration between researchers in the scientific research sector. However, our priority is to diligently protect the safety, security, and privacy of our participants. As a result, our data is only available in very specific circumstances and in accordance with the specific agreement set out in the licence to use the data.   
Having regard for the sensitive nature of the original copyrighted work, UK Biobank does not provide the data in any format other than the secure way it is provided to approved researchers.  
  
Location of infringing material  
  
UK Biobank owns all intellectual property rights over data that has been posted within a number of forked repositories as further detailed below. The data is licensed by UK Biobank to bona-fide researchers to conduct research in association with their approved purpose only and in accordance with contractual terms agreed between the parties. Such licence does not extend to the ability to post the data on a public forum. The original repository from which the infringing material was forked has been removed but we are unable to identify or contact the owners of the forked repositories for the infringing material to be removed.     
  
We have identified the following URLs which contains the specific files within each forked repository that infringe upon our copyright and we request that these files are removed immediately in accordance with the DMCA requirements:
