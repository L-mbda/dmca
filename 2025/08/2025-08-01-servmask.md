**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

[private] the [private] of ServMask Inc., the company that developed and owns the copyright to the Unlimited Extension plugin. As the [private] of the copyright holder, I am authorized to act on behalf of ServMask Inc. in enforcing our intellectual property rights, including filing DMCA takedown notices.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original copyrighted work is a commercial WordPress plugin called Unlimited Extension, developed and sold exclusively by ServMask Inc. through our official website at https://servmask.com/products/unlimited-extension. This plugin extends the functionality of our core All-in-One WP Migration plugin by removing upload size limits and enabling advanced backup, migration, and restoration features.

It contains unique user interface elements, and functionality created and owned by ServMask Inc. Unauthorized copying, distribution, or public sharing violates our copyright.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

https://servmask.com/products/unlimited-extension

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/stingray82/Unlimited-backup

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

ServMask Inc. uses multiple technological measures to control access to the Unlimited Extension plugin:  
1. License Verification: The plugin requires a valid license key, which is verified against our secure license server during activation and updates.  
2. Access-Controlled Downloads: Customers must log in to a secure customer portal to download the plugin. Download links are protected and expire after limited use.  
4. Monitoring and Abuse Detection: We actively monitor download activity, license key usage, and known distribution platforms to detect unauthorized access and sharing.

These measures help restrict access to authorized users and prevent unauthorized distribution or public posting of our proprietary software.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused GitHub repository contains a copy of the Unlimited Extension plugin with the license validation code removed or bypassed, allowing it to be used without a valid license key. By stripping or altering the license-checking mechanisms and removing references to our licensing server, the project circumvents our access controls and enables unauthorized use and distribution of our commercial software. This directly violates our copyright and undermines the technological protection measures we’ve implemented to restrict access to paying customers.
