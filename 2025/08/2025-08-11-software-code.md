**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

[private] was hired by the [private] of the repository to build software components for his web application. I am the [private] and [private] of the software components [private] contributed to the [private] repository. These contributions were made under the expectation of payment as agreed upon with the [private], [private], on behalf of [private]. While most invoices were paid, one invoice (covering significant portions of the backend and collaborative features, more details below) remains unpaid despite numerous reminders and formal notice with return receipt to the registered agent of [private]. [private] acknowledged in writing the validity of the invoice, but keeps delaying the payment since January 2025. He is thereby using [private] copyrighted, unpaid-for software without [private] authorization for half a year at this point.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original copyrighted work includes custom backend and database components, a collaborative CRDT-based notes editor with a dedicated WebSocket server, task/ticketing modules, and team structure management, as well as other smaller components. These components were fully authored by [private] and committed to the repository under the agreement that they would be paid for upon delivery. As payment has not been made, continued use of this code constitutes unauthorized use of [private] copyrighted work.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

[private]  

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

Specific files within the repository are infringing

**Identify only the specific file URLs within the repository that is infringing:**

The following folders and imported components in there are either completely or to a significant extend infringing:

[private]  
[private]

No

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Other Change

**Describe the change.**

The infringing content (or entire repository) should be made inaccessible until the outstanding invoice is paid in full. Once payment is received, I will no longer object to the content being restored or used.

**Do you have the alleged infringerâ€™s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
