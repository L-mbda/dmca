GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] [private] and copyright owner of the project “yulgang-crystal.” [private] developed and published this software under [private] [private] [private] [private]. No one has been authorized to copy, modify, or distribute it outside of [private] repositories.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original work is a custom software project named yulgang-crystal, which [private] created and published on GitHub. It contains source code, documentation, and functionality related to the Yulgang Crystal program. This project includes proprietary logic for licensing, activation, and related features.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

https://github.com/wick44449/yulgang-crystal  
https://github.com/wick44449/yulgang-crystal-web

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

[private] software includes a license key system that must be validated before the program can be used. Each user is issued a unique key, and the software checks the validity of the key against a secure server before granting access. This prevents unauthorized copying or use of the software. The infringing repositories and website provide methods to bypass this license validation, allowing users to access the software without authorization, which circumvents [private] technological protection measures.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused repositories and the associated website provide unauthorized license keys or mechanisms that allow users to bypass the license key validation built into [private] software. This enables anyone to use the software without obtaining a legitimate key from [private], effectively circumventing the technological protection measures [private] have put in place.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

https://github.com/wick44449/yulgang-crystal

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Other Change

**Describe the change.**

The best solution is for GitHub to take action against the user wick44449 by removing the infringing repositories and any associated web applications that distribute unauthorized license keys. This user should be suspended or otherwise restricted from creating new repositories that infringe on [private] copyright, as their actions enable anyone to generate or distribute license keys without authorization, potentially allowing unauthorized use or resale of [private] software.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

I do not have the alleged infringer’s personal contact information. The infringer’s GitHub username is wick44449.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
