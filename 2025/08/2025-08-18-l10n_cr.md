[private] one of the [private] and [private] of the repository located at https://github.com/odoocr/l10n_cr. This project was developed collaboratively by a group of volunteers, and [private] contributed substantially to its source code and design. As a result, [private] hold joint copyright ownership of the original work.

Although we do not operate under a formal company or organization, the repository is the result of our collective volunteer effort, and we retain the legal rights to the code we created. I am submitting this takedown notice on [private] [private] behalf and on behalf of the other original contributors who have authorized me to represent our shared interest in this matter.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original copyrighted work is an open-source software project titled l10n_cr, located at https://github.com/odoocr/l10n_cr. It consists of a set of Odoo modules developed to support [private] electronic invoicing system, in compliance with local tax regulations established by the [private].

The project includes custom modules that implement fiscal document handling, integration with external government APIs, tax calculations, and electronic document generation following the XML schema required by [private] authorities.

The codebase was developed collaboratively by a group of volunteers, and it is released under the GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AGPLv3), which requires that all derivative works preserve the original copyright notices and author attributions.

The repository includes __manifest__.py files for each module, which list the authors and contributors as required by Odoo standards and by the AGPL. These files were modified in the infringing repository to remove the original authors' names, violating the license terms.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

Specific files within the repository are infringing

https://github.com/OdooFeCR/FE-CR/tree/17.0/l10n_cr

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

gnu-affero-general-public-license-v3.0

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The infringing repository is a fork or derivative of our original project released under the GNU Affero General Public License version 3 (AGPLv3). This license explicitly requires that all original copyright notices, author attributions, and license texts be preserved in any modified or redistributed versions.

However, in the infringing repository (https://github.com/OdooFeCR/FE-CR), the maintainers have removed all original author names and attribution information from the __manifest__.py files, which are a standard place to credit contributors in Odoo modules. This removal violates Section 5 of the AGPLv3, which mandates the preservation of author credits to maintain transparency and respect for original creators.
 
Despite being notified of this issue through a formal pull request and issue report ([private]), the maintainers refused to restore the original author attributions, thereby continuing the violation. This failure to comply with the license terms undermines the legal framework that protects open-source contributions and infringes upon our copyright.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

To bring the infringing repository into compliance with the AGPLv3 license, the following changes are necessary:

Restore all original author attributions in the __manifest__.py files and any other relevant documentation or source files where authorship is credited. This includes listing all original contributors by name or username as they appear in the original repository.

Retain the full AGPLv3 license text and notices in all source files and documentation, ensuring that users of the derivative work are aware of their rights and obligations under the license.

Clearly indicate that the repository is a fork or derivative work of the original project, including a link back to the original repository (https://github.com/odoocr/l10n_cr).

If the maintainers are unwilling to comply with these requirements, removing or making the repository private would prevent further unauthorized use or distribution of the copyrighted material.

**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22"fair use</a into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
