Dear GitHub Legal Team,

This is a formal DMCA counter-notice against the false DMCA report filed against [private] repositories https://github.com/enbyte/yolkbot and https://github.com/enbyte/deobfs-shell-source. It is also attached to this email as a file.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter Notice.

The repositories that were disabled are https://github.com/enbyte/yolkbot and https://github.com/enbyte/deobfs-shell-source.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.

I consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.

I would like to dispute this notice. The takedown request submitted to me is not only wholly incorrect, it is also frivolous and unprofessional, following a string of similar reports containing blatant lies despite the claims in the report supposedly being “under penalty of perjury”. In response, this is my formal DMCA Counter-Notice regarding the takedown request submitted by [private]. I believe this takedown is a false claim, as [private] repositories do not infringe on any copyrighted materials owned by [private].

[private] has seemingly hallucinated protections for their software that do not exist and then claimed that [private] repository somehow allows bypassing those protections. While one would hope that there is even a gesture at any of the mentioned protections in the software itself, it appears that [private] lacks both the technical acumen to actually implement them and the legal acumen to understand that lying in a DMCA report is a federal crime.

None of the mentioned “protections” actually exist. For example, one supposed infringement that [private] repository commits is “contain[ing] proprietary map data parsers”. The map data format that the game uses is the industry standard JSON and is so ubiquitous that every web browser, regardless of whether it has ever accessed any [private] content, contains the functionality to parse JSON data. Despite [private] claim that this format is “proprietary”, the JSON standard is officially licensed under the terms that “Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so.”

Signed,
