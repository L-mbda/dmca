Dear GitHub DMCA Agent,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice and I have taken fair use into consideration.

I am writing to notify you of a copyright infringement under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). I request that you remove or disable access to the infringing repository described below.

1. My Contact Information  
Name: [private]  
Address: [private]  
Email: [private]  
Phone: [private]  

2. Identification of the Original Work  
The original work are software repositories named [private] and [private], created and owned by [private], and licensed under [private] name. It features unique design, structure, and functionality, including a distinct shuffle function and specific implementation details.

Original repository URL:

[private]

old main deleted repository(its commit history and name persist in the more recent one and both are atleast 6 months earlier than the stolen content release) : [private]

3. Identification of the Infringing Material  
The infringing repository bears the name and design of [private] original work. It appears to be an AI-generated derivative (fork) of [private] project, reproducing substantial portions of its structure, ui and functionality. The shuffle function is identical, and the overall implementation is materially the same.

Infringing repository URL:

https://github.com/Eithar-Wageh/Memory-Card-Game

https://eithar-wageh.github.io/Memory-Card-Game/

4. Evidence Summary

The infringing user was a collaborator on [private] original repository for a short period of time, confirming they had direct access to [private] work.

The repository name, ui, design, and project structure are identical to mine.

The shuffle function in the infringing code is identical to [private] original implementation.

Core functionality, file structure, and method naming conventions match [private] original work.

Commit history and timestamps show [private] repository predates the infringing one.

I am able to provide side-by-side comparisons, screenshots, commit logs, and license information upon request.
