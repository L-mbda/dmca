To Whom It May Concern,


My name is [private] and I am the [private] at wikiHow. I am writing to file a DMCA takedown notice regarding multiple repositories on GitHub that are infringing on wikiHow’s copyright. I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. 


This letter is a Notice of Infringement as authorized in § 512(c) of the U.S. Copyright Law under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). Pursuant to the DMCA, I assert the following:

The above-referenced URLs/domains are just examples. This copyrighted content is protected by technological measures designed to control access and prevent unauthorized automated copying (scraping). These measures include, but are not limited to, rate limiting and other bot-detection systems intended to ensure our content is accessed in the manner we permit.


(ii) The repositories listed below infringe on our copyrights by either trafficking in circumvention tools designed to bypass our technological measures, or by hosting datasets that are unauthorized copies of our copyrighted content obtained through such circumvention.


A. Circumvention Tools (Violation of 17 U.S.C. § 1201): These repositories provide software primarily designed to circumvent our access controls and facilitate copyright infringement.  Infringing use of these articles may be found on GitHub at the following URLs:

The repositories offering scrapers and APIs are trafficking in circumvention devices in violation of 17 U.S.C. § 1201.
