**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**  
  
I am the [private] at Disc Soft Ltd., the company that developed and owns the reWASD software (https://www.rewasd.com/). I am authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner regarding enforcement and protection of intellectual property related to this product.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**  
  
reWASD is a proprietary Windows software developed and owned by Disc Soft Ltd. It allows users to remap gamepad, keyboard, and mouse controls, and includes advanced features such as mobile controller, combo creation, virtual devices, and more. The software is distributed exclusively via our official website (https://www.rewasd.com/) and is protected by copyright. Any cracked or modified versions enabling use without a valid license constitute a direct copyright violation.  
  
**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**  
  
https://www.rewasd.com/  
  
**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**  
  
**Based on the above, I confirm that:**  
  
The entire repository is infringing  
  
**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**  
  
https://github.com/EugeneSunrise/reWASD  
https://github.com/RedDot-3ND7355/reWASD  
  
**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**  
  
Yes  
  
**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**  
  
reWASD includes built-in licensing and activation mechanisms that validate each user's license key through our secure servers. Access to the full functionality of the software is restricted unless a valid access is purchased and activated. These measures are in place to prevent unauthorized use, duplication, and distribution of the software.  
  
**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**  
  
The accused repositories provide DLL files and instructions specifically designed to bypass the license verification and activation mechanisms of reWASD. They offer modified versions of our software with full functionality unlocked without a valid license key. The README documentation explicitly explains how to replace original DLL files, manipulate licensing traffic, and use man-in-the-middle techniques to override server validation, which directly circumvents the technological measures we use to protect our copyrighted software.  
  
**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**
