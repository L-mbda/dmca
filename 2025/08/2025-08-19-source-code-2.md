**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] [private] and sole copyright owner of the source code copied into the repository identified above. The work was created by [private] in a [private] [private] [private] and has not been licensed or otherwise authorised for reproduction, distribution, or public display. The infringing files contain [private] original file paths and identifiers (for example references to [private] [private] “[private]”), which further evidence authorship and copying.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

I am the [private] [private] and copyright owner of the original source code stored in a [private] [private] [private] under [private] [private]. The work is unpublished and proprietary. I have not granted any licence or permission to the user “Becca-90” (or any third party) to reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from this code. I can provide the original [private] [private] to GitHub upon request to verify ownership.

The copyrighted work is a collection of custom data-analysis scripts for SEIFA (Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas) analysis focused on [private] / [private]. It includes Python/R code for data ingestion, cleaning, spatial joins, calculations, and map visualisation used in consulting work. The codebase contains original module structure, function and variable names, comments/docstrings, and project-specific directory layout.

The infringing repository reproduces substantial portions of these scripts verbatim, including [private] local file paths that identify [private] machine/user directory (e.g., paths beginning with [private]), which are unique to [private] [private] project. The selection, arrangement, and specific implementations (including comments and identifiers) in the accused files match [private] [private] source code. I can supply the original files and diffs [private] to GitHub to verify the overlap.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

The original work is not publicly available online. It resides in a [private] [private] [private] under [private] [private] and has never been published or licensed for public use. I can provide the original source files and side-by-side diffs to GitHub staff upon request to verify ownership and copying.

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Identify the full repository URL that is infringing:**

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The work is stored in a [private] [private] [private] that is not publicly accessible. Access is restricted to [private] [private] only and requires GitHub authentication. [private] account has two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled, and repository access is limited to authenticated sessions over HTTPS/SSH using personal access tokens or SSH keys. No public forks or gists exist for this code.

Copies on [private] computer reside under [private] user profile (e.g., /[private]) on a device protected by OS login credentials and full-disk encryption. Backups, where applicable, are encrypted and not publicly shared.

These measures effectively control access by preventing the public from viewing or cloning the repository and by requiring strong, multi-factor authentication to obtain any access. Any third-party possession of this code would have required unauthorised access or copying from [private] [private] [private] or encrypted local device.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project is not a circumvention tool (it does not break encryption or bypass authentication/DRM). The infringement arises from the unauthorised reproduction and public distribution of [private] [private] source code. By copying [private] code out of a [private], access-controlled [private] [private] and publishing it in a public repository, the accused project defeats the effectiveness of [private] access controls ([private] [private] + authenticated access + 2FA) by making the protected material available to anyone without authentication.

I do not know the precise method by which the code was obtained from [private] [private] [private] or local, encrypted device, but the resulting public publication circumvents the protection in practice by placing copies of the files (including [private] unique local file paths such as [private]) outside the protected environment, enabling unrestricted access, viewing, cloning and redistribution.

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed
