Request:

(1) After investigation, we found that there are users on the open-source community Github platform who have uploaded sensitive internal source code of MeiYijia Holdings Co., Ltd. The source code documents uploaded are personal uploads to Github without permission.

(2) Specific information description:

 In March 2020, user brainedcode uploaded code related to the Meiyijia workflow system without permission. The link is as follows: https://github.com/brainedcode/Abp.Workflow/blob/master/src/MeiYiJia.Abp.Workflow.csproj (Note: Meiyijia is pronounced as meiyijia in Chinese). After verification by Meiyijia's internal security personnel, the project has been renamed the Meiyijia workflow system, primarily used for tobacco bureau interface agents. We hope that GitHub officials will assist in requiring this user to delete the repository https://github.com/brainedcode/Abp.Workflow and cease their infringing activities.
