**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

Specific files within the repository are infringing

**Identify only the specific file URLs within the repository that is infringing:**

No

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

https://github.com/DragonJAR/n8n-workflows-es  
https://github.com/cympotek/n8n-workflows  
https://github.com/rishabharaj/n8n-workflows

**Based on the representative number of forks I have reviewed, I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository.**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

mit-license

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The license is being violated because the infringing repositories have copied the MIT-licensed workflows without including the required full license text or attributing [private] as the original author. The MIT License mandates that any redistribution must preserve both the license and proper credit. By stripping these elements, the infringers are using the work without authorization and disregarding the legal terms established for its use.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

To bring the project into compliance, the infringing repository must include the full text of the MIT License exactly as it appears in the original works and clearly attribute [private] as the original author of the workflows. This can be done by adding the license file and author attribution within each workflow file or at the repository level. Alternatively, making the repository private or removing the infringing files altogether would also resolve the violation. Without these steps, the project remains noncompliant.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No, just their Github

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
