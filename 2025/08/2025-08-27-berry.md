While GitHub did not find sufficient information to determine a valid anti-circumvention claim, we determined that this takedown notice contains other valid copyright claim(s).

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**  
  
I am the [private] and [private] of Berry (berry.com.sa) and the [private] of Mind AI (mind.net.sa), two registered [private] companies that developed the proprietary source code in question. The code was created entirely in-house by our development teams and is protected under our corporate intellectual property policies.  
[private], the individual who published or leaked the source code, is a former employee who was previously granted access solely for internal development purposes. Upon termination of his employment, all access and rights were revoked. He is no longer authorized to use, access, or share any part of our codebase  
As the [private] and representative of both Berry and Mind.net.sa, I am fully authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner to protect our assets and request the takedown of any unauthorized or infringing content published on GitHub.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**  
  
The original copyrighted work consists of proprietary software systems developed by our company, Berry (berry.com.sa), and its affiliated product Mind AI (mind.net.sa). These include:  
1. A full-stack .NET-based enterprise accounting and business management system.  
2. Windows desktop applications developed using C# and .NET Framework for internal operations and POS management.  
3. Mobile applications (Android and iOS) developed by our in-house team for digital sales, inventory, and smart business automation.  
These systems were built entirely under our company's internal [private] organization and infrastructure, using private repositories. All code, APIs, architecture, and documentation were created during the employment of [private] under a formal agreement.  
After the termination of his employment, [private] refused to hand over the repositories, assets, or any credentials related to the systems, despite multiple formal requests. He continued to maintain unauthorized control of the repositories and eventually leaked parts of the codebase.  
We have complete Git commit logs, project plans, and evidence of authorship by our company. The code includes original logic, API structures, class designs, and business workflows specific to our internal architecture. It was never intended to be made public or redistributed.  
This is a clear violation of our copyright and business agreements, and we are requesting immediate takedown.  
  
**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**  
  
Yes, the original copyrighted works are located in the following [private] repositories under our company organization [private]:  
  
1. [private]  
2. [private]  
3. [private]  
  
These repositories were developed and owned by our company. However, the current [private] organization access is fully controlled by a former employee ([private]), who removed our administrative privileges and deleted some of the original private repositories without authorization. [private] am currently listed only as an [private] and have no administrative control over our own code.  
These links show partial access to our original codebase, which has been compromised.  
  
**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**  
  
**Based on the above, I confirm that:**  
  
The entire repository is infringing

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**  
  
Yes  
  
**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**  
  
Our organization has implemented several technological measures to protect and control access to our copyrighted source code, including:  
  
1. **Private [private] Repositories**: All production and development code was stored in private repositories under the company-owned [private] organization “[private]”, inaccessible to the public.  
  
2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Access was limited strictly to authorized developers using [private]’s permission system. Developers were given “write” access only to the specific modules they were assigned to, while administrative privileges were restricted to a few trusted individuals.  
  
3. **Company-Approved [private] Accounts**: Only accounts that were explicitly approved and invited through corporate emails were allowed to access repositories.  
  
4. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Enforced across the entire organization to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials were leaked.  
  
5. **Access Revocation Protocols**: Upon employee offboarding or contract termination, we revoke [private] access immediately, in accordance with our internal IT policy.  
Despite these measures, the former employee ([private]), who had legitimate access during employment, retained control and refused to relinquish access after termination, in violation of policy. He then deleted certain repositories and leaked proprietary content. This unauthorized behavior is what prompted this takedown request.  
  
**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**  
  
The accused project is not designed to circumvent technical protection measures in the traditional sense. However, the former employee ([private]) retained access to our [private] organization after the termination of his employment and misused his internal privileges to take unauthorized control of our repositories, delete critical projects, and leak copyrighted content. This was a clear violation of our access control policies and internal procedures.  
  
While no external hacking or circumvention tools were used, this act constitutes a breach of trust and abuse of legitimate internal access, and thus bypassed our organizational protection mechanisms.  
  
**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**  
  
**Based on the representative number of forks I have reviewed, I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository.**  
  
**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**  
  
No  
  
**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**  
  
Other Change  
  
**Describe the change.**  
  
In addition to removal of the content, we are also requesting restoration of ownership and administrative control of the [private] organization and repositories, as they were created under our company infrastructure and wrongfully retained by the former employee.
