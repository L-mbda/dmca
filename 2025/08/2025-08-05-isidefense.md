Re: Required Takedown of Proprietary Content
To whom it may concern:

I serve as [private] for Industrial Security Integrators, LLC (“ISI”) (https://isidefense.com/). It has come to ISI’s attention that Github user “Jspro0502” posted without authorization certain confidential and proprietary source code belonging to ISI at https://github.com/jspro0502/security-control-backend. The unauthorized publication of this code infringes ISI’s copyrights, could result in financial damage, and violates Github’s Terms of Service. ISI previously reported this unauthorized publication to [private] on July 23, 2025 (attached) but it did not receive a response and the source code is still posted on your website. 

In content posted with the stolen code repository, the Github user (“Jspro0502”) expressly states that they recently worked at ISI and this code is associated with that work. The user also acknowledges this is “Security Control” code, which is an ISI product (see https://isidefense.com/security-control). ISI reviewed this code and confirmed it is proprietary to ISI, and unauthorized publication of this code violates the user’s employment obligations. 

In furtherance of this takedown request, I certify as follows:  
1. ISI read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice;  
2. The copyrighted work is ISI’s proprietary source code;  
3. The infringing work is unauthorized posting of ISI’s proprietary source code at  
https://github.com/jspro0502/security-control-backend;  
1 See https://github.com/jspro0502/security-control-backend/blob/main/Job_Interview_QA_New_Role.md. 2 See https://github.com/jspro0502/security-control-backend/blob/main/Readme.md. 

4. This content must be immediately removed from all public sources and user Jspro0502 must permanently delete all copies in their possession, custody or control;  
5. ISI can be contacted through me (contact information above) or to:  

[private], [private]  
ISI Defense  
[private]  
[private]  

6. We currently have no confirmed contact information for the infringer, user Jspro0502;

7. I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the
infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

8. I have taken fair use into consideration.

9. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and
that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an
exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; and

10. Signature is provided at the end of this letter.  

In view of the foregoing, ISI expects Github to:  
• Immediately remove all copies of the unauthorized material from its website and  
services to prevent further copyright infringement, theft and other damage to ISI;  
• Provide all available contact information for user Jspro0502;  
• Preserve any records relating to user Jspro0502 that may be relevant to civil or
criminal legal proceedings in this matter concerning the user; and  
• Provide a written response confirming all such actions have been taken.

This letter is written without prejudice to ISI’s rights or remedies all of which are expressly reserved.  
Sincerely yours,  
[private]
