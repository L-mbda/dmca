**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] [private] and [private] copyright owner of the software in question. The software is a proprietary, closed-source application distributed under a strict End User License Agreement (EULA), which explicitly prohibits reverse engineering, decompilation, disassembly, or unauthorized extraction of embedded credentials or code. The infringing repository was created by a third party who violated the EULA by reverse engineering the compiled software, extracting confidential API keys and internal logic, and publicly uploading the derived content to GitHub. I am submitting this notice as the rights holder to request removal of the infringing material.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original work is a proprietary software application developed and maintained by [private]. It includes original source code, compiled binaries, configuration logic, and embedded API keys used for secure authentication and service integration. The software is not open source and is protected by copyright law as a creative work in both structure and expression. Distribution is governed by a legally binding EULA that strictly prohibits reverse engineering or unauthorized use of any component. The work is distributed in compiled form only, and no source code is made publicly available.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

To prevent unauthorized access and reverse engineering, the software is distributed in compiled form and has been protected using advanced technical measures, including:  
- Obfuscation to obscure control flow and data logic;  
- Multiple layers of encryption for sensitive components, including API keys and configuration modules;  
- Runtime protection mechanisms to deter static and dynamic analysis.

These measures are designed to control access to the copyrighted content and comply with technological protection standards under the DMCA. Despite these safeguards, the infringing party circumvented these protections to extract confidential information and publicly re-upload derived content, constituting both copyright infringement and violation of the anti-circumvention provisions (17

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project circumvents [private] technological protection measures through unauthorized reverse engineering of the compiled binary. [private] software employs code obfuscation and multi-layer encryption to protect sensitive components, including API keys and a proprietary file format used for data storage.

Despite these protections, the infringer used static and dynamic analysis tools (such as disassemblers and debuggers) to deobfuscate the code, locate encrypted payloads, and extract embedded API keys. They have also begun reverse engineering the structure of the private file format by analyzing memory dumps and binary patterns.

The infringing repository contains scripts and code explicitly designed to:  
- Decrypt protected configuration modules;  
- Parse the undocumented file headers and data layout.

These activities demonstrate a deliberate effort to bypass the technological measures I implemented to control access to the copyrighted work, in violation of 17 U.S.C. § 1201 (anti-circumvention provisions of the DMCA).
