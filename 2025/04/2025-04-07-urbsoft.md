**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] of URBSOFT, the rightful copyright holder of the source code in question.  
The code was developed entirely in-house by URBSoft’s [private] as part of our proprietary product. At no point was this code published under an open-source license, nor was permission granted to any third party to distribute or reproduce it.
I have direct authorization from URBSoft to act on the company’s behalf in enforcing its intellectual property rights.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. All personal information is redacted before being published to our public DMCA repository.**

The copyrighted work in question is proprietary source code developed by URBSoft as part of our commercial software products and internal tools. This includes frontend code, configuration files, project structure, documentation, and original implementation logic.  
This work was created exclusively by URBSoft’s internal [private] team and has never been released publicly or licensed for reuse. The code was stored in our private version control [private] and used in client projects under contract.  
The infringing repository (https://github.com/Akril0/urbsoft) contains identical or near-identical copies of files, folder structures, and business logic that match our original work. This includes specific variable names, function names, architectural decisions, and project configurations that are unique to our internal development practices.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

The original copyrighted work is stored in a [private] and is not publicly available online.  
We can provide access to the original [private] or specific commit history to GitHub’s legal team upon request, to verify our ownership and authorship of the code.

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

The following URL(s) are infringing:

https://github.com/Akril0/urbsoft

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

URBSoft utilizes several technological measures to control access to our copyrighted material:  
1. Private Git [private]  
All source code is hosted on private [private] (e.g., [private]), which are inaccessible to the public. Access requires authenticated credentials.  
2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  
Only authorized developers are granted [private] access, with permissions strictly limited based on role (e.g., read-only, contributor, admin).  
3. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)  
All team members are required to use 2FA on their Git accounts, adding an extra layer of security.  
4. Audit Logs and Monitoring  
Access and modification activities are logged and periodically reviewed to detect any unauthorized behavior.  
5. Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs)  
All employees and contractors with access to the code have signed NDAs legally restricting them from sharing any content externally.

These measures ensure our proprietary code is accessible only to verified individuals under strict security and legal policies. Any unauthorized access or distribution, such as the content found in the infringing repository, constitutes a clear violation of these protections.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project is not necessarily designed to technically circumvent our protection measures, but it appears that an individual with authorized access to our private [private] (e.g., a current or former developer or contractor) intentionally copied and published the proprietary code to a public GitHub repository without permission.  
By doing so, they effectively bypassed the technological protections we have in place—such as private [private] settings, authentication controls, and access restrictions—through unauthorized manual access and redistribution.  
This action constitutes a clear violation of our copyright and security policies, and the public exposure of this content undermines the technological safeguards that were in place to protect it.
