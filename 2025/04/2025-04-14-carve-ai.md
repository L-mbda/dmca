Yes, I am the copyright holder

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**  
Yes

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**  
Github

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**  
I, [private] (GitHub user: [private]), am the [private] of the [private] Grosenick-Lab-Cornell/CARVE-AI [private] (see link below), the [private] and [private] of the CARVE-AI project and corresponding academic publications, and I am the [private] of the official cited CARVE-AI GitHub organization: https://github.com/carve-ai

Neither Cornell University nor [private] have authorized any open-source release or license, including under the MIT License. The repository and its contents hosted at https://github.com/Grosenick-Lab-Cornell/CARVE-AI—including proprietary source code, algorithms, research materials, and internal documentation—are infringing on copyright and IP rights of [private] and Cornell University. The entire Grosenick-Lab-Cornell/CARVE-AI repository contents were developed and maintained in [private] under [private] control and are currently under formal intellectual property (IP) review by Cornell University’s Center for Technology Licensing (CTL).

On April 5, 2025, a GitHub repository under the organization Grosenick-Lab-Cornell was made public and included materials from CARVE-AI without [private] consent or institutional authorization. This constitutes unauthorized publication of proprietary content and violates both [private] copyright and IP rights and Cornell’s internal IP policy (University Policy 1.5).

This is a repeat infringement of content that was previously made public without consent by [private] on July 17, 2024, then made private on July 18, 2024 after direct communication. [private] am now requesting a formal takedown after written communication went unanswered.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed:**  
The work includes proprietary source code, algorithms, model designs, internal research notes, and repository structures created and maintained by [private] in [private].

These materials were never publicly licensed and remain under institutional review. They have now been reproduced in public form without [private] permission and under a false license.  
The infringing repository includes:
- Internal research code and structure
- Commit history from prior private development
- Public display of proprietary algorithms and documentation not released through any public or licensed channel
- Application of an open-source license (MIT) that I explicitly denied in writing

Evidence of prior removal:   
**(Please redact the following links in the public DMCA record due to personal details):**
[private] and [private] provide public evidence of the former violation and takedown. 

Relevant Links:  
https://github.com/carve-ai provides evidence of CARVE-AI project and [private] by user [private], copyright on jointly developed components by [private] and Weill Cornell Medicine, Cornell University.  
https://github.com/Grosenick-Lab-Cornell/.github/commits/main/ provides public evidence of the disallowed public publishing at https://github.com/Grosenick-Lab-Cornell/CARVE-AI occurring on April 5, 2025, which can be confirmed internally by Github records. 

**If the original work is available online, please provide a URL:**  
https://github.com/carve-ai  
Note that only partial code has been released publicly, and with a proprietary license.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology if you are unsure.**  
Yes. While the primary basis for this DMCA takedown is the unauthorized copyright and IP violation described above, the content was also originally stored in [private] under restricted access, with visibility and download permissions limited to approved collaborators (e.g., [private], [private], and [private]).

These access restrictions constitute valid technological protection measures (TPMs) under the DMCA, although this is not the basis of my complaint.

The only public-facing version of this work was hosted on the official GitHub organization CARVE-AI (https://github.com/carve-ai/PCMF), and included only partial code released under a proprietary license, not an open-source license.

**Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately. As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork below:**  
To my knowledge, there are no current forks of the infringing repository.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**  
No. The work is not licensed under any open-source license. It is proprietary and under review by Cornell University’s Center for Technology Licensing (CTL).

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**  
The reported repository must be removed entirely.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information?**  
[private] (GitHub users: [private] and [private])


I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.  
I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

**I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice.**
