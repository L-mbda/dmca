Dear Github Legal Team,

 

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

 

I am submitting this notice to report a case of copyright infringement involving our company's website content. Additionally, the infringing material is being used in a manner that may mislead users into believing it is associated with our company, potentially facilitating an illegal scam.

 

 

1. Identification of the Copyrighted Work

The copyrighted work that has been infringed is the website content of Precision Tax Relief, which is published at https://www.precisiontax.com. This includes text, images, branding, and design elements that are protected under copyright law.

 

 

2. Identification of the Infringing Material

 

The infringing material is hosted on the following GitHub repository:

https://github.com/Jblvck26/PrecisionTax

https://github.com/Jblvck26/PrecisionTaxx

Publishing an exact copy of our website with the same domain name using different TLD “.us” which we do not own.

https://precisiontax.us/

 

This repository contains a direct, unauthorized copy of our website, including its content, structure, and branding. It is being used to impersonate our company under the domain precisiontax.us, which we do not own or operate and are concerned it may also entail other infringements beyond DMCA such as phishing and scamming our clients.

 

 

3. Required Action to Remedy Infringement

To remedy this infringement, the repository owner must remove all copyrighted content derived from precisiontax.com. Given the extent of the copying, the only way to fully remedy the infringement is to remove the entire repository.

 

After contacting [private] they redirected us towards you to conduct the report.
