4. Combined Works.  
You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,  
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the  
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse  
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of  
the following:

a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that  
the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are  
covered by this License.  

5. Combined Libraries.  
You may place library facilities that are a work based on the  
Library side by side in a single library together with other library  
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this  
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your  
choice, if you do both of the following:

a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based  
on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,  
conveyed under the terms of this License.

b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it  
is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the  
accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

The copyright and license notice included in init.lua was outright removed.  
Notices in the listed modules are not sufficient in specifying the copyright and license of the code taken from ox_lib.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

Proper attribution must be added to each file containing code taken from the original work, otherwise the repository must be removed.
