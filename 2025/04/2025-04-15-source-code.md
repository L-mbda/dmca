**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] [private] and copyright owner of the logo, website, and its associated code that are being infringed upon. The copyrighted materials were created by [private] and have been used in [private] [private] [private] business for several years. These materials are protected under copyright law from the moment of their creation and fixation in a tangible form.

The infringing user on GitHub has made a copy of [private] logo and website, including its code, with only minor changes. This unauthorized use is intended to deceive others into believing that their copy of the website belongs to them. Several links within the infringing content still point to [private] original content, while others redirect users to their own content, misleadingly engaging users under false pretenses.

As the copyright owner, I have exclusive rights to reproduce, distribute, and display these materials. The unauthorized use by the infringing user violates these rights. I have a good faith belief that the use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by me, the copyright owner, or by law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original copyrighted work includes the following elements:

Logo: The exact imagery of the logo, which [private] designed, has been replicated without any significant changes. This logo is a distinctive visual representation of [private] business and is protected under copyright law.

Other Images: Various images created specifically for the operation of [private] business have been used without authorization. These images are integral to the visual identity of [private] website and business.

Copy Text: The textual content, including descriptions, articles, and other written materials created for [private] website, has been copied. This content is essential for communicating the purpose and services of my business.

The infringing user has utilized these elements with minimal, if any, modifications, thereby misleading users into believing that their website is associated with or belongs to [private] business. This unauthorized use constitutes a clear violation of [private] copyright.
