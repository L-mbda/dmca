**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and copyright holder of the repository hosted at https://github.com/sodapng/voice-over-translation. [private] released the code under the MIT License, which is included in the repository. [private] retain full copyright ownership of all original contributions in the repository.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. All personal information is redacted before being published to our public DMCA repository.**

The original copyrighted work is the full source code and documentation of the "voice-over-translation" project, which [private] published on GitHub at https://github.com/sodapng/voice-over-translation under the MIT License. This includes all scripts, README files, source code in subfolders, and the LICENSE file. The license permits use and modification with attribution and license preservation, which were not followed in the derivative repository.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

https://github.com/sodapng/voice-over-translation

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

The following URL(s) are infringing:

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Each fork</a> is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately.</i> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork below:**
 
https://github.com/ilyhalight/voice-over-translation  
This fork was originally created from [private] repository, but the fork relationship was later removed. The user also removed the MIT license and replaced it with a more restrictive CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license, which is incompatible with the original MIT license and constitutes a license violation.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

mit-license

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The original repository (https://github.com/sodapng/voice-over-translation) is licensed under the MIT License. This license explicitly requires that any reuse of the code must include the original copyright notice and the license itself.

The user at https://github.com/ilyhalight/voice-over-translation forked [private] repository, then removed the reference to the original project, deleted the MIT license, and replaced it with a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) license. This new license imposes additional restrictions, such as prohibiting commercial use, which is incompatible with the permissive terms of the MIT License.

Changing the license and removing attribution violate the core terms of the MIT License:

- Failure to include the original copyright notice
- Failure to include the original MIT License
- Imposing more restrictive licensing (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) on MIT-licensed code
- Attempting to relicense the work without permission from the copyright holder

Additionally, removing the fork link makes it appear as if the repository is an independent project, which further misleads others and undermines license compliance.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

To bring the repository into compliance with the original MIT License, the following actions must be taken:

1. **Restore Attribution**:  
- Acknowledge the original repository at https://github.com/sodapng/voice-over-translation in the README or equivalent prominent place.
- Reinstate the GitHub fork relationship if technically possible, or otherwise clearly state in the repository’s description or documentation that it is based on [private] original MIT-licensed work.

2. **Restore the MIT License**:  
- Re-add the full text of the original MIT license in a `LICENSE` file.
- Include the original copyright and license notice in all relevant source files or documentation.

3. **Remove or Amend Incompatible Licensing**:  
- Remove the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) license, as it adds usage restrictions (e.g., non-commercial use only) that are not allowed under the permissive terms of the MIT License.
- Alternatively, the user may **add** their own license terms only to their original contributions, **not** the original MIT-licensed code, and this must be clearly separated.

4. **(Optional but helpful) Make the repository private until compliant**:  
- Making the repository private temporarily would help prevent further distribution of the non-compliant version until the above actions are completed.

Once these changes are made, the project can remain public and active while respecting the original MIT license terms.
