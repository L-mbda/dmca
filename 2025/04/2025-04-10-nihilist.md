GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and [private] of the software project "Nihilist: Cisco IOS Security Inspector", which [private] and published on GitHub under the Apache 2.0 license. [private] own all rights to the original source code, documentation, and structure of the project"

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. All personal information is redacted before being published to our public DMCA repository.**

The infringing repository is a direct copy of [private] original project, including the source code and structure. The person who copied it only changed the README file, removed [private] name, and added a fake release tag. This was done without permission and without crediting [private] as the author. [private] repository was created and published first, as shown by commit history and release timeline. This is a clear copyright violation.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

https://github.com/casterbyte/Nihilist

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing

The following URL(s) are infringing:

https://github.com/donatd0/Nihilist

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Each fork</a> is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately.</i> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork below:**

None

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

apache-license-2.0

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The infringing repository contains the full source code of [private] Apache-licensed project without attribution, without retaining the original license, and with [private] name removed. The person falsely claimed authorship and added a misleading release version. This violates the terms of the Apache License 2.0, which requires preservation of copyright and license notices.  
Although [private] name and copyright notice are still visible in the source code, the repository presents the project as if it was developed by the infringer, uses a misleading release tag, and changes the license to MIT. This violates the terms of Apache 2.0 and misleads the public about the origin of the work.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

At minimum, the infringer must remove the repository entirely or clearly restore proper attribution, include the original Apache 2.0 license, and publicly acknowledge the original author. However, since the repository presents itself as an original work and misleads users, full removal is the most appropriate action.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

**Do you have the alleged infringerâ€™s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**
