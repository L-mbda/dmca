Hello,  
I put a repository on public which should have stayed private. And I am now facing a copyright lawsuit. You will find attached the Mise-En-Demeure.  
I removed my repository from public [private] but some forks have been made. I need these taken down within 48h.  
These forks are just copies of my repo without any modifications.
