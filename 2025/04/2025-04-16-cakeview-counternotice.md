CakeView known as "CakeViewer" as per the repository linked by the DMCA notice is a private tool which is available through a paid service on [private] ([private]). Its software and source code are otherwise unavailable.

The purpose of this tool is to overcome the file system's cryptography imployed on the WWE series of games with its latest entry being WWE 2K25 ([private]). It is not an official tool created by the creators of this game, nor is it endorsed.

[private] software "CakeTool" is a tool for which purpose is also to overcome the encryption algorithm of these products. The original notice claims that private code has been stolen as well as comments while "CakeViewer"'s source code is not available. No comments could have been stolen from a compiled program which its source code is unavailable. It also claims that its entire software and code were stolen but no clarification were given - it is evident that both tools are not identical, or even just partially. Cryptography algorithms can often look similar if not identical between implementations.

"CakeTool" has been created using a separate language from "CakeViewer", and is functionally and visually distinct from "CakeViewer" and I believe in good faith the DMCA notice was filled as a result of seeing this tool as competition. Both "CakeViewer" and "CakeTool" have been created as a result of reverse-engineering the original product, WWE 2K25.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**
