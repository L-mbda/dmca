I am the [private] of "M Centers App", "Akshnav" and related "github pages websites" who distributed it as "M Centers".
In my young life, [private] developed this M Centers Piracy tool to get Minecraft from Mojang Studios for free but its a paid game. As I grew up, I closed the distribution of it across all platforms.  
M Centers source code was made public but it was clearly stated that its not open source software and no redistribution , forking or other stuff is allowed for this repository.  
In 2024 Mojang did strike [private] on [private] original repository but forks are still out there.  
I have taken down some other repositories already and here is the reference [private]
