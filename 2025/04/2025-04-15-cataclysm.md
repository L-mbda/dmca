Yes, I searched the dependent forks of Cataclysm: Bright Nights and found the problem commit in the following repositories:

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

CC-BY-SA 3.0 Unported  
In-repository reference https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/blob/master/LICENSE.txt  
Cannonical license text http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

As of commit https://github.com/cataclysmbnteam/Cataclysm-BN/commit/eabec5e1a8c4742b81451422168aa498a2d678f9 these repositories have removed required license text, namely the license notices stating that the project is licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0 Unported from their version of the source. This is also mirrored to any release archives published by any of these repositories.

In plain English, they have unilaterally relicensed the work without the consent of thousands of contributors.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

Restoring the original license via reverting commit https://github.com/cataclysmbnteam/Cataclysm-BN/commit/eabec5e1a8c4742b81451422168aa498a2d678f9 should resolve the issue. There is some question about the termination clause meaning that *tainted* versions of the code after the key commit should also be scrubbed from the repository, but I can at least assert that I personally would have no interest in insisting on that course of action.  
Halting publication of the infringing body of code should also be sufficient but not necessary as long as the licensing issue is resolved.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Other Change

**Describe the change.**

Restoring the original License via reverting commit https://github.com/cataclysmbnteam/Cataclysm-BN/commit/eabec5e1a8c4742b81451422168aa498a2d678f9
