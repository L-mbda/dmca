Note: Because the parent repository was actively being forked when this DMCA takedown notice was received, and the submitter had identified all known forks at the time they submitted the takedown notice, GitHub processed the takedown notice against the entire network of 2 repositories, inclusive of the parent repository.

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am [private], the [private] and [private] of the website and its code. [private] hold the exclusive rights to this content.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The original copyrighted work is the complete source code and assets for the website https://candyleaks.xyz, built with the following stack:

Vite Configuration

vite.config.ts with custom plugins or build settings unique to [private] project.

TypeScript / TSX Frontend

.tsx React components and hooks implementing the UI and user interactions.

Custom layouts, context providers, and state management code.

HTML Templates

index.html and any partial HTML templates that structure the app shell.

JavaScript Utility Modules

.ts or .js helper functions and services (e.g., API clients, formatting utilities) that were written from scratch.

Styling Assets

CSS, SCSS, or Tailwind‑CSS configuration files defining the site’s design system (colors, spacing, typography).

Build & Deployment Scripts

NPM scripts in package.json and any CI/CD YAML or shell scripts that automate building and deploying the site.

Static Assets

Images, icons, fonts, and other media files created by [private] for branding and UI.

All of these components—Vite setup, TypeScript/TSX code, HTML scaffolding, JS modules, styling, build scripts, and assets—are original works authored by [private]. The infringing repositories contain direct copies (or only trivial renames) of these files without [private] authorization.

Infringing Repositories and Accounts

Original Infringing Repository: [invalid]

Re-uploaded Repository: https://github.com/dmca-revival/lol-candyleaks (dmca revival - which is user claiming he openned this account to reupload the script.)

User Account: [invalid]

The individual behind these repositories—operating under the GitHub account [invalid] and the new account dmca-revival—gained access to [private] code by exploiting a vulnerability on [private] website, which allowed them to view and extract private files. They have re‑uploaded [private] code to multiple repositories and even forked the main repository. When [private] exercised [private] legal right to request a DMCA takedown, the user responded by calling [private] “[private]” and stating “dmca takedowns are for [private],” demonstrating clear bad faith and a lack of respect for copyright.

[private] did not authorize this use and request that GitHub remove these repositories and disable the associated accounts under the DMCA.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**

The entire repository is infringing
