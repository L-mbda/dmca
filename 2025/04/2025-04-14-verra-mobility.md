GitHub DMCA Agent,

 

I am writing on behalf of Verra Mobility, the owner of copyrighted material and trade secrets that have been posted on GitHub without our authorization. This letter serves as an official DMCA Takedown Notice under 17 U.S.C. § 512(c) regarding unauthorized disclosure and distribution of our confidential source code and proprietary materials. I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

 

The infringing material appears at the following URL(s): https://github.com/jltho0897/verra-mobility

 

The posted content is proprietary source code and internal business logic owned exclusively by Verra Mobility. This code was developed by Verra Mobility and constitutes both copyrighted material and protected trade secrets under applicable U.S. law.  The individual who posted the material appears to be using a false identity ("[private]") and has no authorization from Verra Mobility to access, share, or distribute our proprietary assets. The publication of this material was made with express intent to extort payment, as confirmed in written communications from the individual to Verra Mobility and third parties.  These communications have been shared with GitHub through Verra Mobility’s [private] ([private], [private]).

 

To be clear, this is a broad takedown request to remove all folders (public and private) associated with the above user ID / credentials.  As GitHub has been made aware by our [private], the GitHub user in question has admitted that he is posting these files – to which he has no legal right – publicly as part of an extortionary demand for payment, which is a clear violation of numerous civil and criminal laws, including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the Defend Trade Secrets Act and also violates GitHub’s Terms of Services and Acceptable Use Policies. GitHub Terms of Service § C; GitHub Acceptable Use Policies § 2.

 

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

 

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

 

My contact information is below, but please include our [private] ([private]) and [private] ([private]) on all communications.
