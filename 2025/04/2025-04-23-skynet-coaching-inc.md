I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. A disgruntled former independent contractor has taken [private] code an posted it online - I filed on this in January of 2023 and you notified me it had been made no longer publicly available but it is not public again. This contractor was working on the code, copied [private] pl-app repo (and possibly others) from [private] Skynet Coaching Inc [private] ([private]), and then posted a copy of the work he was doing publicly. He then threatened that unless [private] paid him more money he would start spreading the work about the repo - I have emails from him with the threats and he even included links to the repo.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The entire repo is [private] work, [private] [private] by Skynet Coaching Inc, this is an exact replica of [private] repo (at the time of his work when he stole it in 2023) so the entire repository is infringing.

**If the original work referenced above is available online, please provide a URL.**

This is the account he set up and where he uploaded the repo (https://github.com/brysondev05/EvolveAI) - it is a somewhat out-of-date version of [private] [private] repo (about 2 weeks old). If you compare with what is in [private] Skynet Coaching [private] it is clear he copied it and is using it to attempt extortion.

**We ask that a DMCA takedown notice list every specific file in the repository that is infringing, unless the entire contents of the repository are infringing on your copyright. Please clearly state that the entire repository is infringing, OR provide the specific files within the repository you would like removed.**

**Based on the above, I confirm that:**
