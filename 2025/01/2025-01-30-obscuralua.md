**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and [private] of ObscuraLua, a Lua obfuscator service. ObscuraLua's proprietary software code and related documentation are protected under copyright law. I have the authority to act on behalf of ObscuraLua in all copyright-related matters. The copyrighted work includes proprietary algorithms, encryption techniques, obfuscation logic, and source code uniquely developed by our team, which have been unlawfully reproduced and distributed.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Dear GitHub Support,

I am the [private] and [private] of ObscuraLua, a Lua obfuscator service offering advanced script security through proprietary encryption and obfuscation techniques. The copyrighted work includes the following:

Proprietary algorithms specifically developed for script obfuscation and encryption.

Distinct obfuscation logic and unique file structures.

Metadata and file headers that identify the obfuscated outputs as generated by ObscuraLua.

These elements are integrated into ObscuraLua software, which is only accessible to authorized users via our official platform: https://obscuralua.com.

The infringing repositories host unauthorized distributions of our proprietary obfuscation system. Specifically:

ObscuraLua-encrypted files: The files in these repositories exhibit distinctive features that match the proprietary outputs of ObscuraLua's obfuscation process, including specific patterns, encryption markers, and structures.

Unauthorized reproduction of source code: These repositories directly include or replicate portions of our proprietary algorithms and logic, which are not publicly available.

Illegitimate use of file headers and metadata: The files contain identifiable markers that indicate unauthorized access and use of ObscuraLua's obfuscator.

These repositories not only contain unauthorized copies of ObscuraLua's outputs but are also being used to facilitate unauthorized access to our obfuscator, bypassing legitimate licensing mechanisms.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**
