**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I'm acting on the behalf of owner of RAULI Solutions Oy, the copyright holder for RAULI Brackets and the application used for calculating solar photovoltaic mounting system components.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original, copyrighted work is RAULI APP, an application created for calculating solar photovoltaic mounting system components. The application is publicly available at https://app.raulibrackets.fi and is also commonly advertised on platforms targeted for professionals, such as [private]. The application is original work done for RAULI Solutions Oy. The application source code and the original graphics designed for the application are original property of RAULI Solutions Oy and have not been published as open source.

The offending repository contains HTML source code and SVG icons dumped from the application. Furthermore there's commit history on the fact that they have just replaced references to RAULI branding with "SnapBracket". The repository doesn't contain any operational logic, just the HTML and graphics dumped from the application. The offending content is only available after registering and logging in to the application, accepting the terms and conditions of the application usage. Furthermore the only content in the offending repository is the content dumped from my client's application with minimal changes.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.
