Dear sir/madam,

At Hogeschool Utrecht we are happily using GitHub Classroom for many years now, for which we are grateful. With the recent beta, we ran into some problems with our template repository being outside the organization for students. We now clone our assignments from a [separate organization](https://github.com/huictstaff/cisq1-lingo). Students make a private fork from this template repository and complete assignments based on this template. This is graded and awarded European Credits (EC). We stated that copyright in derived works (e.g. these assignments) remain at the HU.

However, many students have moved their repository outside the organization and made their repository public. As undertaken or completed assignments remain property from Hogeschool Utrecht, this is a [infringement of our Copyright Policy, section 4.5 and 4.6](https://www.internationalhu.com/-/media/hu/documenten/study-at-hu/hu-copyright-enforcement-regulations.ashx). Furthermore, these repositories are now publicly available, open for students to copy their answers from. We see a huge increase in plagiarism from students copying answers directly, in more than fair use, from these repositories. Plagiarism is an infringement of our Copyright Policy section 3.4 and considered as diploma fraud.

To prevent (former) students from infringing our copyright rules, we ask you to remove all the contents from all repositories listed in the next section.

Thanks in advance, if there are any remaining questions you can reach me at [private] or [private].

Referenced copyright rules from HU Copyright Regulations (HU product number: OOS/J/16.111) 2017; Author: [private]

3.4 Plagiarism  
This subsection pertains to HU regulations and policy in situations where students commit
plagiarism when writing theses, articles and papers, etc. during their degree programme.
Quotations from a work created by someone else will not be deemed to be an infringement of
copyright (Article 15a of the Copyright Act). A quotation will be the case if an adoption
(quotation) relates to the context in which it is used and must be regarded as an essential part
of the whole. A quotation must be of subordinate significance too. In other words, the adoption
must benefit the content of the work to which it is added (for example: convey an impression,
provide an explanation or illustrate an argument) and the quotation must be relatively short.
Another condition is that the work from which a quotation is taken has been communicated
lawfully and been published. Steps must be taken to guard against infringement of the
exclusive right of communication to the public that is vested in the author, being the owner of
the copyright. Therefore, it is customary to provide a source acknowledgement when including
quotations in a text.
(Source: Gebruik van auteursrechtelijk beschermd materiaal in de Digitale Studentenboekerij,
nota Open Universiteit)
If the conditions applicable when using quotations are not observed, plagiarism may be the case.
Plagiarism (Articles 13 and 14 of the Copyright Act):
the publication of a work by someone else as if it were your own (plagiarism). This often goes
hand in hand with the infringement of the copyright vested in the author; this involves the
absence of a source acknowledgement or the adoption of a significantly bigger piece of work
than specified in the source acknowledgement.
N.B. The term “publication” must be interpreted broadly. In other words, the writing of a thesis
or report and its presentation for assessment, as required for the degree programme, will also
be regarded as publication or communication to the public.
What happens if a student exceeds the limits specified?
If students adopt the work of others in their theses and reports, etc. and subsequently present
the work adopted as their own work (plagiarism), this will be regarded as an “irregularity” in the
sense of Article 25 of the HU Education and Examination Regulations (Bachelors’ degree
programmes).
An examiner or the Examination Board will assess whether an irregularity has indeed taken
place; if so, a sanction may be imposed but must be appropriate to the infringement in question.
Students may submit an appeal against the measures and sanctions imposed to the Board of
Appeal of the HU.
In line with previous rulings by the Board of Appeal, the Examination Board must demonstrate
that a student is ‘guilty’ of an irregularity. Where plagiarism is concerned, the student must have
been aware that he/she was adopting the work of someone else

4.5  
The following will always apply for readers:  
- The copyright will be vested in the respective authors of the component parts. If a
reader as a whole is to be deemed to be “a literary, scientific or artistic work” due to
connecting texts, individual explanations, new texts or other circumstances, the
copyright will be vested in the HU, because a lecturer will always be deemed to have
made the reader in the exercise of their duties.

4.6  
If students make a work in the context of their study and this work is protected by copyright in
principle - theses and graduation reports, for example - students will obtain the copyright in the
work in question, unless the HU and the student concerned agree otherwise in advance

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

As explained above, via GitHub Classroom students cloned/copied a [template repository](https://github.com/huictstaff/cisq1-lingo) where the copyrights of derived works (e.g. assignments) remains at the HU. The repositories listed below are a violation of the copyrights rules and must therefore be removed.

The repositories are visible under the forks list of https://github.com/joost56/cisq1-lingo.

Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Via GitHub Classroom, we own the repositories that are created from forking the [template repository](https://github.com/huictstaff/cisq1-lingo) and keep these repositories private.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

Our staff organization does not allow transferring repositories to their own account. We do not know exactly how these GitHub-accounts obtained the rights to transfer their repositories, but we suspect through bugs related to the beta of the new GitHub Classrooms rollout in april/july 2024

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes, I have listed all the repositories I found above.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
