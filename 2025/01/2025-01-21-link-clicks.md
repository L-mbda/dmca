**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

My company, Link Clicks Inc., holds a commercial license for a ReactJS template originally published by AppSeed. This template, which serves as a foundation for website development, has been modified extensively with custom code that we have developed. This modified code, stored in our private [private] at [private], includes additional screens and unique functionality created by us.

We are the copyright owners of the custom code and authorized license holders of the original template. AppSeed, the original publisher, has also granted us permission to act on their behalf regarding this infringement.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original copyrighted work is a ReactJS-based website application designed for managing advertising campaigns. The application includes features such as ad platform authorization, campaign management, analytics comparison, and content management.

We recently discovered that our proprietary code base has been published without permission or authorization at the following repositories:

https://github.com/i-moonlight/ads_manager_frontend  
https://github.com/don2r/ads_manager_frontend

These repositories contain unauthorized copies of our modified work, including custom code and functionality, and violate the commercial license for the ReactJS template.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repositories should be taken down due to the unauthorized publication of copyrighted material. The URLs for the repositories are:

https://github.com/i-moonlight/ads_manager_frontend  
https://github.com/don2r/ads_manager_frontend  
These repositories contain copyrighted code and derivative works that have been published without permission or authorization.

Yes, I conducted a search for forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories. The only repositories I found that contain the infringing content are:

https://github.com/i-moonlight/ads_manager_frontend

I have not identified any additional forks at this time.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**
