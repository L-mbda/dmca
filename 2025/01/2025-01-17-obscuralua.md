Dear GitHub Support,

On behalf of ObscuraLua LLC, I am submitting this DMCA takedown request to report copyright infringement of our original work, ObscuraLua, on your platform. These unauthorized repositories contain unlicensed and modified copies of our proprietary Lua obfuscator software. Below, we have outlined the details of the infringement and request removal of the infringing material.

Description of the Infringement:  
The repository in question includes extensive portions of my copyrighted source code that have been leaked and re-uploaded without my consent. These infringing repositories circumvent intellectual property protections by:  
• Substituting “ObscuraLua” with other terms (e.g., “Prometheus”) in the codebase and documentation to create the false impression that the work originates from another source.  
• Superficially modifying the code while retaining substantial portions of the original functionality, structure, and sequences of ObscuraLua, which are identifiable as proprietary work.  
• Applying unauthorized licensing to the infringing code, misleading users into believing the repository is original or authorized.

Despite the superficial modifications, the repository still directly derives from my original source code, including key features and logic that are exclusive to ObscuraLua. These changes do not eliminate the infringement.

Affected Content:  
Based on my analysis, the majority of the repository is infringing upon my intellectual property, as nearly all of the files contain code directly derived from ObscuraLua. While I have identified key examples of specific files that infringe, the extent of the violation requires the entire repository to be addressed.

Examples of Infringing Files:  
• /src/compiler/compilerA.lua – Contains direct copies of algorithms and functions unique to ObscuraLua.  
• /src/presets.lua – Contains identical code logic, renamed variables, and structural similarities.

Original Work:  
The original copyrighted work, ObscuraLua, was developed as a proprietary Lua obfuscator software, and its source code is protected under copyright law. The unauthorized sharing, modification, or re-uploading of this code violates my intellectual property rights. Evidence of our original work is available on our official website https://obscuralua.com and other verified sources.
