**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] of NSUSLAB, and our company holds the copyright for the materials in question. As the authorized representative of NSUSLAB, I am acting on behalf of the organization to enforce our copyright rights.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original copyrighted works are proprietary software and tools developed by NSUSLAB, specifically including the source code and tools related to our "MonoGame Framework Extensions" and "Rhyme.Tools." These works are part of our internal software development projects and are not licensed for public use or distribution.

Due to the proprietary nature of these tools, they are not publicly posted online. However, the repositories in question contain unauthorized copies and derivatives of this content. Specific examples include:

Custom rendering pipelines and shader code exclusive to NSUSLAB's MonoGame projects.  
Internal utilities and data handling logic unique to our Rhyme.Tools suite.  
Additionally, these repositories were created by a former employee who is no longer with NSUSLAB. Currently, the repositories are set to public visibility without our authorization. We request that these repositories be either made private or deleted entirely to prevent further unauthorized distribution.  

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The following entire repositories should be taken down as they contain unauthorized copies of our copyrighted materials in their entirety:

https://github.com/tylerim/MonoGame  
https://github.com/tylerim/Rhyme.Tools

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

No forks have been identified. If any forks exist, they should also be subject to removal.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Repository can be made private

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No, I do not have the alleged infringer’s current contact information. However, their GitHub username is tylerim, and they were previously associated with our company, NSUSLAB. The email address previously linked to this user was [private], but this address is now used by another employee and may not be valid for the alleged infringer.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
