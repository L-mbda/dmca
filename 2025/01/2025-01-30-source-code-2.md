**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

[private] the [private] of the code included in the repository linked below. [private] original source is hosted publicly at https://github.com/Valgorithms/Civilizationbot and is published under the MIT license, which requires proper attribution and compliance with the terms of the license. The repository owners have altered copyright headers on [private] files, removed proper attribution, and continue to use [private] code after [private] explicitly revoked their license due to these violations.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original copyrighted work is [private] source code, which was published under the MIT license. This code is identifiable in the repository linked below and in the commits history. I can provide further evidence of [private] authorship upon request.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repository located at:  
https://github.com/New-Civ13/Civilizationbot

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

No, I have not identified any forks yet.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes.

**Which license?**

It was originally licensed under an MIT license, but I have revoked their license to use the code due to noncompliance with the license terms. I also had a private agreement with the fork's owner that gave them additional license, which has also since been revoked.

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The MIT license requires proper attribution to the original author, including maintaining the copyright notice in all copies of the software. The repository owners removed the copyright headers and failed to provide proper attribution. They also continue to use the code after I revoked their license due to noncompliance with these terms.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

Restore the original copyright headers and attribution to [private] work in all files where [private] code is used. Ensure the repository includes the full text of the MIT license and references the original author. Cease using the code unless proper attribution is provided and the terms of the MIT license are fully adhered to.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No, I do not have their direct contact information anymore, but they are the [private] of the repository at https://github.com/New-Civ13 and are actively hosting [private] source code at [private].  Commit [private] references the [private] [private]

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
