While GitHub did not find sufficient information to determine a valid anti-circumvention claim, we determined that this takedown notice contains other valid copyright claim(s).

---

**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**  
Yes, I am the copyright holder.  

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**  
Yes  

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**  
GitHub  

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**  
I am the copyright holder.  

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  
[private] the game "Survev.io," which is accessible at https://survev.io.  

The reported repositories contain code that has decompiled and modified our game's client-side source code to create cheats, including an aimbot. These cheats undermine the integrity of our game and bypass our anti-cheat protections.  

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**  
- https://github.com/Drino955/Survev-Krityhack  
- https://github.com/ThatDevExotic/Survev-Client  

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content?**  
Yes  

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**  
Our game employs obfuscation to protect its client-side source code. Obfuscation transforms human-readable code into a format that is intentionally difficult to interpret or reverse engineer. Specifically:  
1. **Code Transformation:** Variable names, function names, and logical structures are replaced with meaningless identifiers to prevent understanding and modification.  
2. **Runtime Encryption:** Portions of the code are encoded and can only be executed within the proper runtime environment of the official game client.  

These measures effectively control access to the proprietary game code by making it extremely difficult for unauthorized individuals to reverse engineer or modify the code for their purposes.  

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**  
The accused repositories circumvent these measures by:  
1. Using tools and techniques to decompile and deobfuscate the client-side code, revealing the original proprietary logic.  
2. Modifying the decompiled code to create cheats, including an aimbot, that exploit the game's mechanics and bypass our anti-cheat system.  
3. Distributing the modified code, enabling unauthorized users to bypass our technological measures and compromise the integrity of the game.  

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories?**  
Yes. At the time of this report, no infringing forks were identified.  

**Is the work licensed under an open-source license?**  
No  

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**  
The reported content must be removed.  

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**  
No  

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**  

**I have taken [fair use](https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22) into consideration.**  

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**  

**I have read and understand GitHub's [Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice](https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/).**
