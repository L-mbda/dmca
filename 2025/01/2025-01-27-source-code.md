**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] of the original repository and the code is entirely [private], original and unlicensed.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

My original repo: [private]  
Rehost: https://github.com/Scoooom/PokeRogue-Pokedex  
They are 100% identical.  
Note that I have no problem with the "fork", but the published website resulting of said fork.

Just an example:  
original repo: [private]  
copy: https://github.com/Scoooom/PokeRogue-Pokedex/blob/main/src/speciesPanelUtility.js

Edit to answer "Currently, your notice does not adequately identify the original copyrighted content. Since the original content is in a [private], please revise your notice to provide a detailed description of exactly what the content is or provide screenshots so we can see the content. In addition, please provide a more detailed explanation of the exact nature of the infringement and how exactly the reported content is infringing on your original content.":

I have unpublished the website from the original repository, there is nothing to show.  
You can check the rehosted website here: https://scoooom.github.io/PokeRogue-Pokedex

I am unsure how "Both repo are 100% identical" is not considered a detailed explanation of the exact nature of the infringement.
If I really have to do your job myself then here you go: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository#choosing-the-right-license
It clearly says: "You're under no obligation to choose a license. However, without a license, the default copyright laws apply, meaning that you retain all rights to your source code and no one may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from your work."  
Publishing a website using 100% of my source code seems like a good definition of reproducing my work.  
It also says everyone is free to fork my repository, just to be clear since this may sound confusing for anyone not working for github for example, this does not allow anyone to reproduce my work, but I'm sure this wouldn't fool anyone working for github, right?

In case anyone also wants to take an extra 30 seconds to actually check what is going on, the repository I'm trying to take down was created after I made my [private], but again, this wouldn't fool anyone working for github, I'm sure.

And finally, in case anyone really wants to take a minute to really to their job properly they can also click on the rehosted repository: https://github.com/Scoooom/PokeRogue-Pokedex  
they would see that the name of the last commit of that repository is "Removed leftover wayback artifacts", anyone is free to interpret that as they want, I'm sure someone working for github wouldn't be fooled.

Hopefully this clears any confusion that may be left.
