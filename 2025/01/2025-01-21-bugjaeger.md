**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

The following repo contains copyrighted resources extracted from [private] app:  
https://github.com/IsHacker003/Adfree_Bugjaeger

The user extracted content from proprietary app that is available at google play:
Bugjaeger Mobile ADB - USB OTG - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.sisik.hackendebug

He extracted copyrighted files/resources directly from the apk file (e.g. various images like [private] app logo res/mipmap-hdpi
/logo.png, or crucial resources like arm65-v8a/libadb-sixo.so) without any permission from copyright owner ([private]). The copyright notice is even visible directly inside the libadb-sixo.so file inside of this github repo. He basically created a pirated version of [private] app. He is even admitting what he did in his readme file. He obviously has no association with me and [private] apps.

Note that he modified the original app, so it doesn't display ads, and tried to spread it as pirated version through github. This could potentially cause financial damage to the original developer and copyright holder ([private]).

Prove that I'm the [private]:
- I have a  [private] that actually contains source code of Bugjaeger. There you'll be able to e.g. find the logo, or the text " [private]" that I embedded into the native .so libraries that he copied  
-  [private] should be available at google play (within EU)  
- Additionally, there are cross references between Google Play App description, [private] blog sisik.eu, and [private]. Those should allow to logically deduce that I have control over the Google Play App

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories?

No

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Other Change

**Describe the change.**

I obviously expect the removal of repository. But this user specifically decided to spread pirated version of software through github, and I just can't believe that github would keep this kind of user on their platform.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
