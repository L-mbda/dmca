Hello Dear Github:

I am an amateur developer. Many years ago, when I was still a student and not very familiar with Git, I accidentally uploaded  project to GitHub and made it open source. Recently, while browsing GitHub, I discovered that this project is still in an open-source state. I changed  project to [private] (only to prove that this repository is mine; I will also delete it if GitHub helps me remove the other person's repository), but I found that it has already been forked by someone else, which is quite troublesome because it contains some network interfaces that I randomly collected from the internet, which could potentially affect others. Moreover,  advisor told me that this project should not be open source and should be considered private property.


I would like to request the deletion of the following repository. I can't contact the other party; they seem to be a bot that is forking projects everywhere.

The following screenshot can prove that I am the [private] of the repository.The [private] used to send the message is also  associated [private]

You can see that each submission is linked to my GitHub account
