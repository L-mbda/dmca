**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

Mitchell Silberberg & Knupp LLP is counsel for Digital Extremes, Ltd. (“Digital Extremes”). As you may be aware, Digital Extremes is the developer and publisher of the highly popular online multiplayer game “WarFrame” (“WarFrame”). As such, Digital Extremes is the owner of all rights, title, and interest, including all rights under copyright law, in and to WarFrame.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The copyrighted work is a free-to-play online multiplayer video game developed and published by Digital Extremes Ltd., titled WarFrame, which is available to download for free exclusively from the official website: https://www.warframe.com/. The game includes original software code, proprietary game mechanics, graphics, and design elements that are protected by copyright law. The source code used in the game is not open-source and remains the exclusive intellectual property of Digital Extremes Ltd.

The infringing repository provides access to code that creates a sandbox environment replicating the functionality of WarFrame. This environment allows users to bypass downloading the game from our official source and instead run unauthorized copies of our game through modified code. The code in the repository either directly reproduces sections of our proprietary source code or provides unauthorized derivatives of our work. This is in clear violation of our copyright.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**
