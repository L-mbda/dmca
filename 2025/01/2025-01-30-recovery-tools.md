**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am authorized to act on behalf of RecoveryTools Inc., the copyright owner of the source code in question. We own all rights to this proprietary code, which was developed internally by our team.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original copyrighted work is the proprietary source code of RecoveryTools Inc.’s activation generator, a critical component of our software’s licensing system. This code has not been made publicly available

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The following specific directory and its subdirectories contain copyrighted material belonging to RecoveryTools Inc. and should be taken down:

Main Directory:  
https://github.com/anomous/Warez-RadiXX11-RCE/tree/main/Advik-BitRecover-RecoveryTools-Turgs%20Keygen

Subdirectories:

https://github.com/anomous/Warez-RadiXX11-RCE/tree/main/Advik-BitRecover-RecoveryTools-Turgs%20Keygen/Bin

These directories and their contents infringe on our copyright by hosting the proprietary source code of our activation generator. I kindly request that GitHub take down these specific directories and their files.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Yes, our proprietary software includes technological measures such as license key verification, activation server validation, encryption, and hardware locking to control access and protect the software from unauthorized use

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project is specifically designed to circumvent our technological protection measures in the following ways:

Unauthorized License Key Generation:  
The accused project includes the source code of an activation generator, which is a proprietary tool used to validate and control access to our software. By hosting and distributing this activation generator, the project enables users to generate unauthorized license keys, bypassing our licensing and activation system.

Bypassing Server Validation:  
Our software uses a secure server-based validation mechanism to verify license keys during activation. The accused project allows users to bypass this process entirely by providing tools to generate keys locally, thereby negating the need for communication with our secure activation servers.

Reverse Engineering Proprietary Code:  
The repository includes decompiled and reverse-engineered versions of our proprietary source code, including forms, resources, and unit modules. This allows unauthorized users to analyze and exploit the logic of our software’s protection mechanisms.

Disabling Hardware Locking Features:  
Our licensing system incorporates hardware-based locking to ensure that licenses are tied to specific devices. The tools and code hosted in the repository circumvent this feature, allowing unrestricted use of our software across multiple devices without proper authorization.

Unlocking Paid Features Without Authorization:  
The project enables users to unlock premium or restricted features of our software, which are otherwise accessible only to legitimate users with valid licenses.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes, I have searched for forks of the repository. At the time of submission, I have not identified any forks.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No, I do not have the alleged infringer’s contact information.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**
