**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I'm legal representative of VyOS Networks, the company behind the VyOS project https://github.com/vyos

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

https://github.com/vyos/vyos-build  
https://github.com/vyos/vyos-1x

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/umlumpa/vyos-build  
https://github.com/umlumpa/vyos-1x

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

No forks from infringing repos

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

GPL 2.0  
LGPL 2.1

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

Our project is under the GNU GPL and other FOSS licenses,
but umlumpa did not follow the requirements of those licenses to keep copyright notices intact.
Instead, he went on to remove copyright notices completely,
such as in https://github.com/umlumpa/vyos-build/commit/c18a8ea995af5de60dbd140711ee4dc68e9370c2#diff-1e38a67f56c6ebec58d85c9b85a1554af024f50726dba6f2c6fd06631b7f0afdR131
or in
https://github.com/umlumpa/vyos-1x/commit/512e9649fa8be85fd2bafd78bccedaf8a3feef1e#diff-13c7c184e32505bd9831fe2d991183af9f49fe2e1e0737ce70a2d3c6923f3ac1

In some cases, he replaced attributions of work while keeping dates untouched,
like here where he edited a Debian package copyright file to make it look as if
he was the original packager in 2017:
https://github.com/umlumpa/vyos-1x/commit/512e9649fa8be85fd2bafd78bccedaf8a3feef1e#diff-248a3ad2376574c96e7b8fc79764c5a217d4d41c8bf8679bcca1c3b7b87f8ff2L1

We believe that his actions violate the GNU GPL and actions must be taken against that behavior.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

Since copyright notices were removed intentionally, they need to be returned or repositories removed

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

https://github.com/umlumpa

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
