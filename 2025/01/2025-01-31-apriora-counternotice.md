**Are you the owner of the content that has been disabled, or authorized to act on the owner’s behalf?**

Yes, I am the content owner.

**Please describe the nature of your content ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

The content on our website has been sourced from the same places as the owner's ([private] questions, [private] posts, etc.. ), so any similarities are due to that. You can verify this by copying and pasting any content from our website; you'll likely find it matches a [private] comment from 2013 (before the inception of [private]). We have ensured that we have not included questions from [private] on our site. We are not even certain that [private] is the original owner of the content, as websites like [private] and [private] have also listed the same questions. Regardless, we are not using these questions on our website, and this can be easily verified by browsing through it.

Despite the baseless nature of this claim, we may have to wait 14 days to gain access to our repository again if the DMCA takedown stands. This will hurt the marketing campaign that we have launched.

**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

The [private] of [private] has been continuously harassing us in various ways by sending anonymous emails to our [private], since we have revealed our identities as the creators of the Open Source initiative [private].

We would like to obtain information and are considering taking legal action against them for harassment.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**
