To GitHub’s DMCA Agent,  
  
I am the [private] and representative of MakeMHz LLC, the developer of proprietary software and firmware for the original Xbox, including but not limited to Project Stellar and XboxHD+.  
  
This is a formal notification under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), 17 U.S.C. § 512(c), requesting the removal of infringing content hosted on GitHub.  
  
1. Copyrighted Work Infringed:  
Original firmware, software routines, and system-level logic developed by MakeMHz LLC for the Project Stellar and XboxHD+ products. These works are proprietary and have never been released under an open-source license. They include unique implementations and internal logic not publicly available or licensed for reuse or modification.  
  
2. Infringing Material:  
The following GitHub repositories contain direct copies or derivative works of both proprietary and GPLv2-licensed code, without attribution, and/or in violation of the terms of the GPLv2:  
  
https://github.com/Team-Resurgent/PrometheOS-Firmware  
https://github.com/Bowlsnapper/PrometheOS-BSX  
https://github.com/ChaoticWolf/PrometheOS-Firmware  
https://github.com/Ernegien/PrometheOS-Firmware  
https://github.com/SkyeHDD/PrometheOS-Firmware  
  
These repositories include:  
  
Code structure, function logic, and specific internal implementations that are unique to MakeMHz LLC and were not obtained through reverse engineering.  
  
Direct reuse of GPLv2-licensed code without proper attribution or license reproduction, and in repositories that are otherwise licensed under GPLv3 or contain no license at all, which creates a license compatibility conflict.  
  
Example of infringement:  
Original Work (GPLv2-licensed):  
https://github.com/MakeMHz/xbox-hd-plus-app/blob/main/src/EEPROM.h  
https://github.com/MakeMHz/xbox-hd-plus-app/blob/main/LICENSE  
  
Unauthorized Copy:  
https://github.com/Team-Resurgent/PrometheOS-Firmware/blob/main/PrometheOSXbe/PrometheOSXbe/hdmiSettingsManager.h  
  
This use is not compliant with the GPLv2 because:  
- There is no attribution to the original work.  
- The required GPLv2 license text is not included.  
- The work is improperly relicensed under GPLv3, which is not automatically compatible with GPLv2 without the “or later” clause—which is absent in our license.  
  
3. Statement of Good Faith:  
I have taken fair use into consideration. I have a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.  
  
4. Accuracy and Authority:  
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.  
  
5. Contact Information:  
  
Full Legal Name: [private]  
Company: MakeMHz LLC  
Email: [private]  
Phone: [private]  
Address: [private]  
  
Sincerely,  
[private]  
MakeMHz LLC
