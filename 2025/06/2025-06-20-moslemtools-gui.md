**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and [private] of the "Moslem Tools" software, which is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3). [private] created the initial codebase and remain the copyright holder. [private] former collaborator was a contributor but did not create the original work or hold the primary copyright.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.**

The code for this project, including all original commits and intellectual property, belongs to [private].

**If you are reporting an allegedly infringing fork, please note that each fork is a distinct repository and <i>must be identified separately</i>. Please read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">forks.</a> As forks may often contain different material than in the parent repository, if you believe any of the repositories or files in the forks are infringing, please list each fork URL below:**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

gnu-general-public-license-v3.0

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3), under which [private] original work is licensed, explicitly requires the preservation of all copyright notices and proper attribution to the original authors. The alleged infringer, MesterAbdAlrhmanMohmed, has copied [private] entire codebase to his repository (https://github.com/MesterAbdAlrhmanMohmed/moslemTools_GUI) and **has completely removed all attribution to [private]** as the original author and copyright holder. He presents the work as solely his own, which is a direct violation of the GPLv3's terms regarding author identity and the mandatory inclusion of original copyright information.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

To bring the project into compliance with GPLv3, the infringing repository must:

1. **Restore Full and Proper Attribution:** Clearly and prominently attribute [private], "mesteranas" (or "[private]"), as the original author and copyright holder of the "Moslem Tools" project in the license file, and any other relevant documentation or source code headers.  
2. **Include Original License File:** Ensure a complete copy of the GPLv3 license is present within the repository.  
3. **Acknowledge Derivative Work:** If he intends to continue using the codebase, it must be presented as a derivative work based on [private] original "Moslem Tools" project, explicitly linking back to [private] original repository.  

Simply making the repository private would not resolve the issue, as the core violation is the removal of [private] copyright and attribution from a codebase that was derived from [private] work. The issue is about proper acknowledgment and compliance with the copyleft nature of GPLv3.

**Do you have the alleged infringerâ€™s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

GitHub Username: MesterAbdAlrhmanMohmed
