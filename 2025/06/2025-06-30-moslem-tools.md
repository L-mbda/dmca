Yes

**Which license?**

gnu-general-public-license-v3.0

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The GPLv3 license requires that all original copyright notices and proper attribution to authors be preserved. The infringing repository removed [private] ([private]) entirely from the README, the license file, and the source code headers, despite my substantial contributions (284 commits, over 35 million lines of added content, including all major database and backend files). The project was copied and republished without any mention of [private] authorship, violating both the attribution and license inclusion requirements of GPLv3. This presents the work as entirely authored by the other contributor, which is inaccurate and against the license terms.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

To bring the repository into compliance with the GPLv3 license, the following changes are required:

1. Add full and visible attribution to [private] ([private]) in the README file, LICENSE file, and source code headers where appropriate.  
2. Restore acknowledgment that this is a derivative of our joint work, including a clear reference to [private] repository.  
3. Include the GPLv3 license file if not already present.  
4. Remove any false claims of sole authorship.  
5. If these conditions cannot be met, the repository should be taken down entirely to stop the misrepresentation and license violation.
