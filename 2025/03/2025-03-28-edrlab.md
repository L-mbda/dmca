Readium LCP is a DRM solution, i.e. a set of technological copyright protection measures through copy control and encryption. Ebook distributors, e.g. public libraries and online booksellers, are using LCP to limit the dates between which a publication can be read, the number of characters a user can copy/paste or the number of pages a user may print. They can also control that the content is not overshared.  
The core LCP specification (https://readium.org/lcp-specs/releases/lcp/latest) defines the notion of encryption profiles. Encryption profiles are a way to include a secret algorithm in an otherwise open solution, secrets being the basis of effective technical protection measures.  
We are the copyright owner of the official LCP encryption profile used by ebook distributors worldwide (Profile 1.0). More information about our role relative to LCP is found in https://www.edrlab.org/readium-lcp/. LCP adopters are listed in https://www.edrlab.org/readium-lcp/certified-apps-servers/.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The LCP encryption profile 1.0, its algorithm and associated keys are not posted online, nor open in any manner. Instead, they must be licensed through an explicit agreement with EDRLab.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The following git repository contains circumvention technology that enables users to illegally access ebooks protected by copyright  
https://github.com/Parithi/lcpl-to-pdf-decrypter

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The protection is based on the encryption of each publication resource. Without going into details of the LCP technological measures, only trusted LCP-compliant client applications can give access to unencrypted content. To decrypt such encrypted content, LCP-compliant applications use a user passphrase and a secret algorithm which is part of the LCP encryption Profile 1.0. LCP-compliant client applications cannot save decrypted ebooks.  
LCP possesses several interesting characteristics:  
* This DRM solution is available on every client platform (iOS, Android, Windows, MacOS, Linux, specific eInk Readers); with the open-source Readium development toolkits, EDRLab provides an open-source codebase which eases such integration. LCP does not lock the user into a proprietary environment. This is why e-lending libraries are moving to this solution worldwide.  
* The DRM solution is especially useful for library e-lending, providing loan extensions and early return features.  
* This DRM solution does not hurt the accessibility of the content it protects for people with reading impairment; this is why it is promoted by the DAISY Consortium.  
* This DRM solution lets users share LCP-protected ebooks with friends and family; there is no predefined number of devices that can use an LCP-protected ebook.
* This is the only DRM solution which is based on an open standard. This means that inspecting the software for flaws is easy. The encryption profile is the only confidential information.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The user has published on GitHub software which specifically allows the decryption of ebooks protected by the LCP Profile 1.0 and allows saving them as non-protected ebooks. This infringement violates our legal business and affects authors’ and publishers’ IP.  
The file which explicitly deals with LCP circumvention is:  
https://github.com/Parithi/lcpl-to-pdf-decrypter/blob/main/lcpl-to-pdf-converter.py  
It contains a "master key", which should not be exposed, and corresponds to a hack of the algorithm of the LCP Profile 1.0.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Other Change

**Describe the change.**

The purpose of this repository is to illegally access copyrighted material, and the content of the repo was illegally obtained. The repo and its forks must be shut down entirely.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

We have no information regarding the identity of the alleged infringer beyond his Github account name.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**
