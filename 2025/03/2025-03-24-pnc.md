Dear [private], 
 
We represent The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (“PNC”) in intellectual property matters. 
 
As you are no doubt aware, PNC is a global financial leader, offering a full range of banking and financial services to businesses and individuals alike. PNC has extensively used and advertised its PNC Powerlink logo on its official website for years:

PNC also owns the domain name, which it uses internally in connection with creating new computer programs, as well as quality assurance issues connected with PNC’s online systems and products. All PNC source code is copyright protected and none of the source code PNC uses is available to the public.
 
PNC has learned that numerous GitHub users have posted PNC’s copyrighted source code to their GitHub repositories. PNC has reviewed the following files, folders, and repositories and, among other things, they: (1) contain files that incorporate the domain name; (2) reference “PNC,” “pnc-bank,” “pnc.com,” or “powerlink” in the file/folder/repository name itself; and/or (3) contain files that display the PNC Powerlink logo, all of which confirms that they contain PNC’s copyrighted information. See Exhibit 1 (URLs and screenshots of infringing files).
 
In addition to the files listed on Exhibit 1, PNC has reviewed the following folders and repositories and confirmed the files contained in them are all PNC copyrighted material:

These activities constitute copyright infringement under 17 U.S.C. § 501 et seq. Accordingly, PNC demands that GitHub, Inc. immediately disable the following URLs:

Thank you for your attention to this very serious matter. If you have any questions, please contact me directly.
