I have read and understood GitHub's Guidelines for filing a DMCA notice.
 
I am filing this DMCA takedown request because my copyrighted work was copied and posted without my permission. Below are the details of the infringement:
 
Identification of the copyrighted work:  
This is a commercial project of mine that [private] developed and released under copyright. This project is not officially registered, but remains [private] intellectual property. The following is a description of the work:
 
Project name: Imperator Client/NitroClient_Legit
 
Description:  
Legit client for Minecraft written in Java using the Forge API
 
([private] [private]): [private]
 
[private] have full sources of the project, they are both in the [private] [private] of [private] (link provided above) and on [private] and I can prove at any time that this project is [private].
 
Identification of infringing material:  
A cracked and partially deobfuscated version of [private] client in the user repository: https://github.com/Librry1337/iperartor
 
The repository contains a modified version of [private] code that was obtained by illegally circumventing security features (hacking). I claim that the entire repository infringes [private] rights because it contains a derivative of [private] work that was not authorised for distribution. The author of the repository also makes no secret that it is a crack, which is why the repository description says ‘[private]’
 
Steps to remedy the infringement:  
The only way to remedy the infringement is to remove the repository completely, as it consists mostly of unauthorised copies of [private] software.
