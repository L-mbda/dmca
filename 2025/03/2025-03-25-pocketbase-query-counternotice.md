Good evening,

A few days ago, the [private] of `pocketbase-query` asked [private] to add a reference to his library in [private] documentation and include the MIT license. Here is [private] conversation: [private]. [private] did exactly that. However, I was unaware that I needed to include his license, not just a MIT license, in [private] repository. Now that I understand the situation better, I will not do so.

It is now clear to me that he believes I copied his code, but that is not true, as I already explained in this post before publishing my repository: [private]. This post "[private]" was the only content I saw before writing my own code—nothing more. I did not review his source code, download his library from [private], or use any part of it.

It is true that after creating the foundation of my library, as I mentioned in my previous post, I looked at his code to compare approaches, as I did with other query builders. I noticed that he had a function called `[private]`, which he used in each basic operator. I thought it was a good name and a convenient abstraction, so I adopted it in my own implementation. That does not mean my code is his code. if I removed that, my code would still work exactly the same and be exactly the same.

In our conversation [private], he could have told me that I needed to include his MIT license, and at that time, I would have done so without issue, as I wasn’t fully aware of the implications. However, now that I have a better understanding of the situation, I will not include his license because I did not copy his code, and my repository is not a fork of his project.

[private] have given him proper attribution in [private] README for inspiring [private] to create `pb-query` and for the similarities in syntax, but after all the time and effort [private] have put into this project, I will not say that my code is his—because it simply isn’t.

PS: I already submitted a counter notice a few days ago, but it seems there was an error and it was not sent correctly.
