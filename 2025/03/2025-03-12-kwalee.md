**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

Employee ([private]) of the organisation.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

We, Kwalee Ltd, (www.kwalee.com) are a video game publisher and developer.

It has just come to our attention that a former employee of Kwalee, [private] (Ph: [private]) (the “Infringer” or “[private]”) has uploaded a folder containing Kwalee’s confidential and proprietary files (the “Content”) to his personal GitHub account without Kwalee’s permission. This account is open to be viewed and accessed by the public.

Copyright Content & Private Information

The unauthorised Content can be found at:  
https://github.com/libintomgit/devopslibin/commit/4051c444b78cbf17c3bcbacc6a43840879796eda#diff-e6224d85d0067ae5479b4f2b8587424ad30c05c4d3c1a1cd41eb14af6955d73f

As you will see, the folder containing the Content is entitled ‘from kwalee laptop’. This Content was uploaded by the Infringer on his last day of employment with us i.e., 26 August 2022 before he handed back his Kwalee laptop.

These actions were in direct contradiction of [private]’s contract of employment which required him to “not at any time, either during or after termination of [his] Employment (however arising) whether on [his] behalf or in any capacity on behalf of any other person, firm, company or organisation use, disclose or allow to be disclosed to any person or organisation, or use for the Employee’s own advantage, any Confidential Information”.

The Content includes text, software code, databases and API keys created by Kwalee employees in the course of their employment with Kwalee and in which the copyright is, as a result of their employment contracts and the operation of copyright statute, owned by Kwalee.

Further, the Content also discloses and exposes personal data in the form of Kwalee’s (present and past) employee’s names and email addresses:  
https://github.com/libintomgit/devopslibin/blob/4051c444b78cbf17c3bcbacc6a43840879796eda/Tableau_prod_data_api/all_user.csv

The Content is also “private information” for the purposes of the GitHub Private Information Removal Policy because it (i) should have been kept confidential as set out above, and (ii) poses a security risk to Kwalee to the extent that it contains (a) the names and email addresses of Kwalee’s past and present employees, thereby posing a cyber security and identity theft risk; (b) API security keys; and (c) confidential information pertaining to Kwalee’s business operations that will be of commercial benefit to its competitors and therefore damaging to Kwalee’s business.

DMCA Takedown Notice & Private Information Removal Request

We have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. We have taken fair use into consideration. The affected user, [private], must immediately and permanently delete all copies the Content wherever it may be stored, including from Github.com. All other rights and remedies are hereby reserved.
