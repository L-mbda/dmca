I have drafted this notice as a business representative of Neosonyx, which holds the legal rights to the Wolfteam source code uploaded by the reported user.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The GitHub user [private] is distributing code on GitHub that enables the creation of an illegal private server for our online game. This action infringes on our legally protected assets and impacts our revenue.

★I reported the user [private], and GitHub has responded to my notice. Thankfully, they also informed me about forked repositories that I was not aware of. Now, I would like to report those forked repositories as well. ★ I really appreciate that you informed me about another fork repository. I saw that the address provided a list, but I didn't know it was folk itself (10th March).
