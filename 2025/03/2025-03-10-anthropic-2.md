**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am [private] for the copyright owner, Anthropic PBC.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original work is our Claude Code research preview repo, at https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code. This original work was developed by Anthropic, PBC. That repo, when first created, contained additional files beyond what is now shown at that link.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The repo at https://github.com/mandeep511/OpenAGI/tree/main/

Each of the files contained in that path are infringing copies of the original work, as they existed at the time of creation of the repo. As described in the repo's readme itself: "OpenAGI is a standalone coding assistant built from the TypeScript code extracted from the official Claude Code package by Anthropic. I've forked and removed the authentication requirements. Now you can use all the features with just an Anthropic API key - no login process needed."

Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Based on the representative number of forks I have reviewed, I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository. I am claiming the entire repositories reported as forks are infringing on our copyrights:
