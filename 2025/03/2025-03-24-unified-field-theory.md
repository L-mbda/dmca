No

Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I have checked the site and identified only these three links.

I did not implement explicit technological measures such as DRM or password protection to restrict access to [private] copyrighted content. However, the old versions of [private] books were only available for purchase as eBooks before they were unpublished. [private] did not distribute these versions to anyone privately. The unauthorized copies currently hosted on GitHub were obtained without [private] permission and are now being distributed in violation of [private] copyright.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Other Change

**Describe the change.**

The best solution for this alleged infringement is for GitHub to remove the unauthorized copies of [private] books currently hosted in this repository. These versions were formally unpublished, and their continued distribution is a violation of [private] copyright. I request that GitHub take immediate action to take down the infringing content.

However, I am open to discussing with the repository owner the possibility of posting updated versions with restrictions (e.g., non-downloadable, view-only format). If the repository owner is interested in such an arrangement, they may contact me at [private] to discuss proper attribution and content control.

**Do you have the alleged infringerâ€™s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No. But I have the user name: [private]  

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
