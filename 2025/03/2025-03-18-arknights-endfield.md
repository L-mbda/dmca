**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

We are the original creator of the computer software for the game "Arknights: Endfield", which includes all source code, executable files, and related documentation. The software was independently developed by us and qualifies as an original work protected under copyright law. We retain exclusive ownership of all rights, including reproduction, distribution, and creation of derivative works.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Arknights: Endfield is a real-time 3D RPG with strategic elements. It includes original source code, executable files, and related assets. The infringing material on GitHub is a private server that modifies my game's code to enable unauthorized features, directly violating my exclusive rights as the copyright owner.
For more information, please see our official website: https://endfield.gryphline.com/en-us/.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

The copyrighted software is protected by multiple technological measures:  
Code obfuscation: Critical components are obfuscated to prevent unauthorized analysis.  
Encryption: Proprietary algorithms and asset files are encrypted to restrict access.  
License validation: A digital rights management (DRM) system verifies user licenses via a secure server API before granting access.  
These measures effectively control access to the software and its functionality, ensuring only authorized users can utilize it as intended.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The infringing GitHub repository distributes tools/methods that directly bypass my technological protections:  
Deobfuscation scripts: Reverse-engineers obfuscated code to expose and modify core game logic.  
Cracked license keys: Generates unauthorized licenses or patches the DRM validation process to grant illegal access.  
Decryption tools: Extracts encrypted assets for reuse in unauthorized derivatives.  
By distributing these circumvention tools, the project enables unauthorized access and modification of my copyrighted software.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**
