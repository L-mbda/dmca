I am a legal representative of Epic Games, Inc., authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner regarding Fortnite & Fall Guys related intellectual property. I am submitting this request to report unauthorized distribution of copyrighted game files.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The repositories listed below are distributing unauthorized copies of Fortnite & Fall Guys iOS application files (IPAs). Fortnite is a copyrighted game developed and owned by Epic Games, Inc. The distribution of these files without authorization violates our copyright and terms of service.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Epic Games employs digital rights management (DRM) and other technological protection measures to control access to its software and prevent unauthorized distribution. The official Fortnite app is encrypted and protected to prevent unauthorized copying or redistribution. Additionally, extracting or "dumping" the IPA files requires modifications to an iOS device, which bypasses Apple's security measures and violates both Apple's and Epic Games' terms of service.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused repositories distribute unauthorized Fortnite IPA files that have been extracted from legitimate installations of the game. Extracting these IPA files requires bypassing Epic Games' digital rights management (DRM) protections and Apple's iOS security measures. This is typically done through methods such as jailbreaking the device or using tools to decrypt and "dump" the IPA files from a legitimate installation.

By distributing these IPAs, the repositories enable users to sideload and install Fortnite without authorization, circumventing Epic Games' and Apple's security mechanisms. This violates Epic Games' Terms of Service and infringes on our copyright by facilitating unauthorized redistribution of the game.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes, I have checked for forks of these repositories. Any forks containing the same infringing content should also be taken down as they continue to distribute unauthorized copies of Fortnite IPAs.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
