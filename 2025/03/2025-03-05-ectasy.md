**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.  
The code listed there is a leaked and deobfuscated version of a project [private] owned named Ectasy. The project has since shut down yet the code should still remain private, hence my request to take down this repository.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original copyrighted work was previously available at [private] as well as https://ectasy.wtf  
You can see references to those domains in the code:  
- credits in the plugin.yml file of the leaked code here: https://github.com/WonderlandLibrary/plugin-sources/blob/main/sources/Ectasy%20SRC/plugin.yml  
- auth api request of the deobfuscated code here: https://github.com/WonderlandLibrary/plugin-sources/blob/main/sources/Ectasy%20Deobf/fr/body/ectasy/command/impl/LoginCommand.java

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

Please take down eiher the entire repo, or those two folders:    
https://github.com/WonderlandLibrary/plugin-sources/blob/main/sources/Ectasy%20SRC    
https://github.com/WonderlandLibrary/plugin-sources/blob/main/sources/Ectasy%20Deobf

Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Our source code was private on the GitHub platform, under the GitHub organization [private]. Furthermore, our code was obfuscated, and this obfuscation was reversed then later posted on github (hence the "Ectasy Deobf" folder name)

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused project contains a part of the source code for the Ectasy project as well as a deobfuscated version of it.

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
