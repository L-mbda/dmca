GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] and [private] of the repository SeafileClientBuildTools, which was first published at https://github.com/xnervwang/SeafileClientBuildTools. The repository contains [private] original code, including scripts, configurations, and project structure.

The repository https://github.com/vmcitrix/SeafileClientBuildTools is a direct copy of [private] project, but it is not a fork from [private] original repository. Instead, the owner has cloned [private] project, made minimal changes by replacing [private] GitHub repository URL in the Dockerfile and Makefile, and then re-uploaded it as if they developed it independently.

This action constitutes copyright infringement, as it falsely presents [private] work as their own without any proper attribution or authorization.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original copyrighted work is [private] repository SeafileClientBuildTools, which is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/xnervwang/SeafileClientBuildTools.

[private] repository was first published on November 24, 2019, with the latest commit on November 25, 2019. This repository contains original scripts, configurations, and build tools specifically created for the Seafile client. It includes:

Custom build scripts for automating the compilation and packaging process.  
Configuration files that define the build environment.  
A structured project layout that was designed and implemented by [private].  
The repository https://github.com/vmcitrix/SeafileClientBuildTools is an unauthorized copy of [private] work. The repository was created on April 11, 2022, and contains a single commit that includes the entire codebase, erasing all commit history. The only modifications made were replacing [private] GitHub repository URL in the Dockerfile and Makefile, while the rest of the code remains identical.

Additionally, this repository was not forked from [private] original repository. Instead, the owner cloned [private] project, modified the repository URL, combined all commits into one to erase authorship history, and re-uploaded it as their own work. This is a clear attempt to misrepresent the ownership of the code and constitutes a direct copyright infringement.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repository https://github.com/vmcitrix/SeafileClientBuildTools should be taken down.

This repository is a direct copy of [private] original work, https://github.com/xnervwang/SeafileClientBuildTools, with only minor modifications to the Dockerfile and Makefile URLs.

Since the core content, structure, and scripts remain identical, and the commit history has been erased to misrepresent ownership, I request the removal of the entire repository.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes, I have searched for forks of the infringing repository. As of my last check, there are no forks. However, if any forks exist, I request GitHub to remove them as well, as they would also contain [private] copyrighted content.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Other Change

**Describe the change.**

The best solution for the alleged infringement would be one of the following:

The infringing repository https://github.com/vmcitrix/SeafileClientBuildTools should be completely removed. This repository is a direct copy of [private] original work https://github.com/xnervwang/SeafileClientBuildTools with only minor modifications to repository URLs in Dockerfile and Makefile, while the rest of the code remains identical. Additionally, the commit history has been erased to misrepresent ownership.

Alternatively, if the owner of the infringing repository wishes to continue using [private] work, they must delete their current repository and fork [private] original repository instead. This will ensure that proper attribution is maintained, and the original commit history is preserved as required by GitHub’s guidelines for open-source projects.

Given that the repository was not forked but was instead cloned and re-uploaded with misleading attribution, I strongly request GitHub to enforce one of the above solutions.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
