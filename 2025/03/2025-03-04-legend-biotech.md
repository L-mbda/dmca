I am reaching out on behalf of Legend Biotech regarding a repository that was created by a former employee, who used a GitHub account registered with our company email ID. The repository was created three years ago, and the employee has since left the company. Unfortunately, we no longer have access to this account as their email ID has been deactivated.

Reason for Deletion: The repository contains company-owned code, and we need to either take control of it or have it deleted, as we have an official GitHub Enterprise account for such projects.
