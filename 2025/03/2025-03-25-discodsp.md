I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

Identified Copyrighted Work:

I am writing on behalf of discoDSP regarding copyrighted presets that were originally created as paid work for discoDSP. These presets were intentionally removed from our official [private] repository because they include proprietary paid work that is not licensed under GPL 3.

Identified Infringing Material:

The following repositories contain our copyrighted presets that are being distributed without authorization:

https://github.com/studiorack/obxd  
Specifically, the infringing presets can be found at: https://github.com/studiorack/obxd/tree/master/Documents/discoDSP/OB-Xd/Banks

These presets were originally in our discoDSP GitHub repository but were deliberately removed due to their proprietary nature. These presets represent paid work that is protected by copyright and is not covered under the GPL 3 license that applies to the source code of OB-Xd.

Required Actions to Remedy Infringement:

The infringing repositories need to remove all preset files that originated from our proprietary collection. Specifically, all preset content should be removed while the GPL-licensed code may remain.
