Dear GitHub DMCA Agent,
I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

1. Identification of Copyrighted Work  
I am submitting this notice on behalf of Playsaurus, the publisher of Cookie Clicker on Steam.

These sites are distributing Cookie Clicker in violation of DashNet's copyright, and we request their removal.
