**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**  
  
Yes  
  
**Which license?**  
  
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3  
  
**How do you believe the license is being violated?**  
  
The repository contains code that is substantially copied from my copyrighted work. My code is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3). The infringing repository is using [private] GPLv3-licensed code in a manner that violates the terms of the GPLv3. Specifically, the repository has failed to license the entire derivative work under GPLv3, as required by Section 5 of the GPLv3. Instead, the repository is using a proprietary license, which is incompatible with the GPLv3's copyleft requirements. This failure to properly license the derivative work under GPLv3 constitutes a copyright infringement.  
  
**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**  
  
Adding attribution to all files that this project contains code from ProtoHax, and change the license to GPLv3.  
  
**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**  
  
Repository can be made private

No  
  
**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**  
  
**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**  
  
**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
