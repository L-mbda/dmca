GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

[private] the [private] and copyright owner of the open-source project pocketbase-query, which is licensed under the MIT License. The project was publicly released at https://github.com/emresandikci/pocketbase-query and includes a requirement for attribution, which has been violated by the infringing repository.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

[private] project, pocketbase-query, is a query builder for PocketBase written in TypeScript. It allows developers to construct structured queries fluently. The repository includes an MIT license, which explicitly states that all copies or substantial portions of the software must include attribution to the original creator.

The infringing repository, pb-query (https://github.com/sergio9929/pb-query), has taken substantial inspiration from [private] project and has replicated its method structure, operator handling, and core logic without including the required MIT license attribution.

Furthermore, the repository owner has publicly admitted on [private] that my project inspired their work:  
Reddit post for reference: [private]

Despite this, the infringing repository does not include [private] copyright notice or MIT license in its files, violating the terms of the license.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repository pb-query violates [private] copyright and should be taken down unless the required MIT license attribution is added.

Repository URL: https://github.com/sergio9929/pb-query

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I have searched for forks, and at the time of this filing, I have not identified any that also infringe. However, if new forks arise, I request they be included in this takedown.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

MIT

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The repository sergio9929/pb-query has used substantial portions of [private] project, emresandikci/pocketbase-query, which is licensed under MIT.

The MIT license explicitly requires that all copies or substantial portions of the software must include the original copyright notice and permission statement. However, the infringing repository does not include [private] MIT license or attribution, violating the license terms.

The repository owner has also publicly admitted on [private] that [private] project inspired their work:  
Reference: [private]

Despite this, they have not included the required MIT license or given proper credit in their repository, making this a clear violation of the license terms.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

To comply with the MIT license, the repository owner should:

- Include the original MIT license file from [private] repository (https://github.com/emresandikci/pocketbase-query).  
- Provide proper attribution in the repository's README, stating that their project is derived from pocketbase-query.  
- Ensure that all copies and forks of the project contain the required MIT license notice.

If the repository owner refuses to comply, I request that GitHub take down the repository (pb-query) for violating open-source licensing terms.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Other Change

**Describe the change.**

To comply with the MIT license, the repository owner must:

- Include the original MIT license file from [private] repository (https://github.com/emresandikci/pocketbase-query).  
- Provide clear attribution in the repository's README, stating that their project is derived from pocketbase-query.  
- Ensure that all copies and forks of the project contain the required MIT license notice.

If the repository owner refuses to comply, I request GitHub to remove the infringing content.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
