**Are you the owner of the content that has been disabled, or authorized to act on the owner’s behalf?**

Yes, I am the content owner.

**Please describe the nature of your content ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

The material was removed due to a misunderstanding of copyright law. While the claimant contributed some suggestions regarding the project, they did not write or contribute to the actual source code. Copyright protects the tangible expression of an idea (such as written code), not mere ideas, concepts, or suggestions. Since [private] wrote the entire codebase, the takedown request was improper.

**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

The material was removed due to a misunderstanding of copyright law. While the claimant contributed to some suggestions regarding the project, they did not write or contribute to the actual source code. Copyright protects the tangible expression of an idea (such as written code), not mere ideas, concepts, or suggestions. Since [private] wrote the entire codebase, the takedown request was improper. Additionally, the claimant later created their own version of the application, which appears to be derived from [private] original work. This suggests that their DMCA claim was made in bad faith as a retaliatory action rather than a legitimate copyright enforcement. Furthermore, the claimant registered an [private] envelope on [private], which is months after [private] completed [private] original code, further indicating that the claim is without merit.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**
