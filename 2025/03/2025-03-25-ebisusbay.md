While GitHub did not find sufficient information to determine a valid anti-circumvention claim, we determined that this takedown notice contains other valid copyright claim(s).

---

**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Are you submitting a revised DMCA notice after GitHub Trust & Safety requested you make changes to your original notice?**

No

**Does your claim involve content on GitHub or npm.js?**

GitHub

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

[private] the [private] and [private] of Ebisu's Bay, a GameFi NFT marketplace and DEX on the Cronos blockchain. [private] own all intellectual property rights to our codebase, which was developed by our team and contractors under work-for-hire agreements. I have full legal authority to submit this DMCA takedown request as the copyright owner.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The repository contains our proprietary frontend codebase for Ebisu's Bay (app.ebisusbay.com), which we've been developing since November 2021. This includes our NFT marketplace functionality, GameFi reward systems, and DEX trading platform built on the Cronos blockchain. Our code is stored in [private] [private] repositories and has never been licensed for public distribution. The repository also contains sensitive configuration files that expose our internal infrastructure including domain configurations, CDN endpoints, and deployment processes.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repository should be taken down:  
https://github.com/crypto-cooker/ebisusbay_frontend

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

We maintain our code in [private] [private] repositories that require authentication credentials. Access is restricted to authorized team members only through username/password authentication combined with SSH keys for deployment. We use role-based access controls to limit who can view, edit, or deploy our code. Our deployment pipeline requires multi-step verification, and we maintain audit logs of all repository access. These measures effectively limit access to only authorized personnel with legitimate business need.

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The individual was temporarily granted authorized access as a contractor, but subsequently misappropriated our code by downloading it while having legitimate access credentials. After their contract terminated, they publicly published our entire codebase without authorization, effectively circumventing our access controls. The publication of our code on GitHub represents an unauthorized distribution that bypasses our technological protection measures, as it makes publicly available code that should only be accessible to authenticated, authorized users of our [private] [private].

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I've searched for forks and have not identified any at this time. If any forks are discovered, I will submit additional DMCA notices for those repositories.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

The GitHub username is "crypto-cooker". The individual worked for us under the false identity "[private]" with an address in [private], but we believe this information is fraudulent.

He used the email address: [private]

His personal website lists additional contact information: [private]  
Phone: [private]  
Address: [private]  

I can provide documentation ([private], contract) separately if GitHub requires it as part of the investigation.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
