**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

There are none.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

**Which license?**

Our work is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) Version 3.

**How do you believe the license is being violated?**

The project Doge V4 / Doge Unblocker is licensed under the AGPL v3, which requires that any modified and redistributed versions:

Preserve legal notices and copyright information (AGPL v3, Section 4). The offender, [private], has removed all visible credits and copyright notices from our original work without replacement.  
Provide a clear and accessible link to the source code (AGPL v3, Section 13). While the offender has uploaded the source code to GitHub, they have failed to provide any clear notice or link to it on their website, making it difficult for users to access as required by the license.  
Since AGPL compliance is a condition of redistribution, their failure to meet these terms means they are distributing our copyrighted work without a valid license, which constitutes copyright infringement.

We request the immediate takedown of the Arctic Math repository until they fully comply with the AGPL v3 terms, including proper attribution and a clearly visible link to the source code.

**What changes can be made to bring the project into compliance with the license? For example, adding attribution, adding a license, making the repository private.**

1. Restore Attribution

They must restore any removed copyright notices that were originally present in the Doge V4 / Doge Unblocker source code.  
This includes credits in source files, documentation, website footers, or any other locations where they were originally displayed.  
2. Clearly Provide the Source Code

The AGPL v3 (Section 13) requires that if software is used over a network, users must be given an easy and obvious way to access the source code.  
They need to add a visible link to their GitHub repository on their website, ideally in the footer or an "About" section.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

I do not. All I currently have is their Github username, "mathpunch", and their [private] username, "[private]".

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
