According to this license in Section 2(a)(1)(b) it says "produce and reproduce, but not Share, Adapted Material.". A website and repo under "youshallallperishtothemightylordposidon/youshallallperishtothemightylordposidon.github.io" has done this. They also have changed the website to say that it was made by them.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

They have copied it from [private] website and repo under "https://github.com/astrogames06/astrogames06.github.io". This is a game website which has [private] name on the page.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I have checked for certain forks but only ones that claim ownership of the code should be removed.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

Yes

Because in Section 2(a)(1)(b) it says "produce and reproduce, but not Share". The other repo has violated this.

All i need them to do if change the name back to "Astro games" and change the credits from "By [private]" to "[private]"

Reported content must be removed
