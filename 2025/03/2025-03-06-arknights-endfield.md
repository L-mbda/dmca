GitHub  

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**  

[private] are the [private] of the computer software for the game "Arknights: Endfield", which includes all source code, executable files, and related documentation. The software was independently developed by [private] and qualifies as an original work protected under copyright law. We retain exclusive ownership of all rights, including reproduction, distribution, and creation of derivative works.  

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  

Arknights: Endfield is a real-time 3D RPG with strategic elements. It includes original source code, executable files, and related assets. The infringing material on GitHub is a private server that modifies [private] game's code to enable unauthorized features, directly violating [private] exclusive rights as the copyright owner.   
It is worth noting that the original name of allegedly infringing files or repositories was “EndFieldPs.” Although it has now been changed to “ArkFieldPS,” I believe this does not alter the fact that it still infringes my copyright.  
For more information, please see our official website: https://endfield.gryphline.com/en-us/.

**Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**  

Yes  

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?** 

The copyrighted software is protected by multiple technological measures:  
Code obfuscation: Critical components are obfuscated to prevent unauthorized analysis.  
Encryption: Proprietary algorithms and asset files are encrypted to restrict access.  
License validation: A digital rights management (DRM) system verifies user licenses via a secure server API before granting access.  
These measures effectively control access to the software and its functionality, ensuring only authorized users can utilize it as intended.  

**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**  

The infringing GitHub repository distributes tools/methods that directly bypass my technological protections:  
Deobfuscation scripts: Reverse-engineers obfuscated code to expose and modify core game logic.  
Cracked license keys: Generates unauthorized licenses or patches the DRM validation process to grant illegal access.  
Decryption tools: Extracts encrypted assets for reuse in unauthorized derivatives.  
By distributing these circumvention tools, the project enables unauthorized access and modification of my copyrighted software.  

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  

Yes. Please see a list of all of the forked repositories [private] 
I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repository. And I wish to have them taken down.  

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**  

No  

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**  

Reported content must be removed  

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**  

No.  

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**  

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**  

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**  

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
