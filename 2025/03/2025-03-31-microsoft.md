Please see our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice#complaints-about-anti-circumvention-technology">Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology</a> if you are unsure.**

Yes

**What technological measures do you have in place and how do they effectively control access to your copyrighted material?**

Microsoft PlayReady is built upon a sophisticated, multi-layered digital rights management framework that employs proprietary cryptographic techniques and controlled distribution channels. Key technical measures include:

• Secure Key and Certificate Distribution: PlayReady secrets—including Group Keys and device-specific certificates—are generated within and protected by secure hardware and software ecosystems. They are disseminated exclusively to authorized partners through legally binding licensing agreements, ensuring that only entities that have met strict compliance and security standards can access the protected material.

• Encryption and Authentication: Our DRM framework uses industry-leading encryption protocols and secure authentication mechanisms. This prevents unauthorized entities from reconstructing valid licenses or decrypting protected content. Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) and secure key storage further mitigate risks by safeguarding critical cryptographic ingredients against extraction or tampering.

• Policy Enforcement and Integrity Checks: PlayReady incorporates runtime integrity verification and secure challenge–response protocols. These measures validate that the operational environment is authentic and has not been compromised or reverse-engineered. Our robust revocation mechanisms ensure that any unauthorized use or distribution of cryptographic material can be curtailed quickly through certificate revocation and system updates.

Collectively, these measures create a closed ecosystem where access to our proprietary secrets is tightly controlled and monitored, ensuring that only authorized operations under valid licensing agreements are permitted.


**How is the accused project designed to circumvent your technological protection measures?**

The accused GitHub repositories are engineered in a manner that subverts the core technological protections embedded in PlayReady:

• Reverse-Engineering of Proprietary Components: The project explicitly builds upon the “mspr_toolkit” – a tool that was originally designed under controlled conditions. By reverse-engineering, manipulating, and repackaging parts of this tool, the project provides users with instructions and code to recreate functionality that replicates sensitive aspects of our DRM ecosystem.

• Extraction and Reconstruction Methods: The project contains functionality and guidance aimed at extracting and reconstructing keys or certificates from sources that should be controlled. For instance, it describes methods to retrieve cryptographic elements from legacy devices or encrypted firmware binaries—actions that directly circumvent our secure key distribution and licensing processes.

• Bypassing Secure Licensing Protocols: By distributing code that enables users to generate “PlayReady Device (.prd)” files outside of our authorized system, the project undermines the exclusive process of device provisioning and license issuance. This bypass effectively negates the integrity checks and cryptographic protections that we have employed to enforce usage under a valid licensing regime.
