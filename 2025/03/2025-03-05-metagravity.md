[private]

These [private] contain previous versions of our cloud platform management tool internally known as (the) Platform. It includes a system that allows users to create and manage virtual machines and related cloud resources using the MetaGravity Platform. It relies on ansible and terraform to orchestrate said resources in [private], [private] and [private] via a MetaGravity created [private]. If necessary we can supply internal documentation, tech design and diagrams.  
The above [private] are owned by MetaGravity. No collaborator has the right to share them without written consent. The only people with access to this [private] are current employees or past employees who did not fulfil their end of the offboarding as agreed in their contract.  
We allow past employees to share code when doing so does not infringe on the company's rights or otherwise harms it in any way.
The user leonchist ( https://github.com/leonchist ) has forked both the above repos. This caused a security issue since they originally contained sensitive information pertaining to access and security.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

These repos should be taken down:  
https://github.com/leonchist/Binarite_CLI_V1

No

**<a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/dmca-takedown-policy#b-what-about-forks-or-whats-a-fork">Have you searched for any forks</a> of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes. We have not managed to find any other forks.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement?**

Reported content must be removed

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No. All we have is the user page: https://github.com/leonchist  
If we could contact them we would have.  
We would much prefer a conversation to this route. We would ask them to please take down the repos and share what they needed in a legal and not harmful way after a conversation with the company.  
We understand that there are fair and good reasons to share work one might have been part of creating. We're all coders. We've all been there. But as it stands there is an unidentified user sharing private (company owned) repos without permission. If possible we would love it if github could ask them to reach out to us for a conversation.
